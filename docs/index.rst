Common Astronomy Software Applications
======================================

`CASA <https://casa.nrao.edu/../>`__, the *Common Astronomy
Software Applications*, is the primary data processing software
for the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(`ALMA <https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/alma/>`__) and Karl G.
Jansky Very Large Array
(`VLA <https://public.nrao.edu/venue/the-very-large-array/>`__),
and is often used also for other radio telescopes.

**6.4.1 Release**

CASA 6.4.1 can now be (`downloaded <https://casa.nrao.edu/casa_obtaining.shtml>`__) for general use. CASA 6.4.1 is based on CASA 6.4.0, and the downloadable tar-file includes the pipelines for ALMA Cycle 9. 

**Highlights:**

- simulator: for ALMA Band 1, parameters were updated in simulation tasks and tools
- tclean: handling of mixed correlation setups was added to tclean
- bug fixes


For more details on these and other new features, see the CASA 6.4.1 (`Release Notes <https://casadocs.readthedocs.io/en/v6.4.1/notebooks/introduction.html>`__).
   
CASA is developed by an international consortium of scientists
based at the National Radio Astronomical Observatory (NRAO), the
European Southern Observatory (ESO), the National Astronomical
Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), the Academia Sinica Institute of
Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA), CSIRO Astronomy and Space
Science (CSIRO/CASS), and the Netherlands Institute for Radio
Astronomy (ASTRON), under the guidance of NRAO.
