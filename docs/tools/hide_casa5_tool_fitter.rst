   tool fitter description
   
   A fitter provides a light-weight (eg, no images necessary) for
   fitting various functions to data. The tool has no state and thus
   all the methods are static; there is no open() method because the
   tool does not "attach" to anything like the image analysis or ms
   tools do.
