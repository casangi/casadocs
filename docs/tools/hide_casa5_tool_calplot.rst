Description
   applycal task: Apply calibrations solution(s) to data
   
   calplot is a plotting tool for calibration tables of all types
   (B=bandpass, G=gain, D=instrumental polarization, P=parallactic
   angle, T=troposphere, M=baseline-based gain, MF=baseline-based
   bandpass, and K=fringe fitting). The default plot style is
   single-panel, but if an iteration axis is specified, multi-panel
   plots are supported. Zooming and region-based flagging is possible
   on single and multi panel plots.
