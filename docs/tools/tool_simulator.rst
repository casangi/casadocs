Description
   **simulator** provides a unified interface for simulation of
   telescope processing. It can create a MeasurementSet from scratch
   or read in an existing MeasurementSet, it can predict synthesis
   data onto the (u,v) coordinates or single dish data onto (ra,dec)
   points, and it can corrupt this data through Gaussian errors, an
   atmospheric model, or through specific errors residing in (anti-)
   calibration tables.

      # Import simulator:
      import simulator as sm
   
   #. In **sm.observe**, **simulator** creates a MeasurementSet and
      calculates uvw values. You first make a **simulator** tool,
      with the name of the MeasurementSet that you wish to construct.
      Next you use the various parameters to set up the observing
      details (*sourcename*, *spwname*, *starttime, stoptime*, etc.).
      Then you call the **sm.observe** method for each observing scan
      you wish to make, or **sm.observemany** to create several
      scans. You specify the *sourcename*, *spwname*, *starttime,*
      and *stoptime*. After this, you have a MeasurementSet that is
      complete but *visibilities=0*.
   #. In **sm.predict**, you fill a MeasurementSet (either one newly
      created or a pre-existing one, perhaps from a real telescope)
      with data from a model or componentlist, and then corrupt the
      measurements (if desired).
   
   .. note:: Info: **sm.predict** assumes model image units are Jy/pixel,
      and in fact will overwrite the brightness units of the image
      itself!
   
   The ft method of the imager tool can also be used to calculate the
   model visibility for a model image or componentlist.
   
   | To apply errors, first set up the various effects using the
     relevant **simulator** methods, and then call **sm.corrupt**.
   | Some important details:
   
   -  One call to **sm.observe** generates one scan (all rows have
      the same *SCAN_NUMBER*).
   -  The *starttime* and *stoptime* parameters specified to
      **sm.observe** need not be contiguous and so one can simulate
      antenna drive times or other gaps.
   -  Currently there is no facility to calculate patterns of
      observing, such as mosaicing, since it is easy to do this via
      sequences of calls of **sm.observe**, or
      **simutil.calcpointings,** or the **simobserve** task
   -  The heavy duty columns (*DATA, FLAG*, *IMAGING_WEIGHT*, etc.
      are tiled. New tiles are generated for each scan. Thus the TSM
      files will not get very large.
   -  **sm.predict** (*incremental=False*) calculates new
      visibilities and replaces the *DATA* column,
   -  **sm.predict** (*incremental=True*) calculates new
      visibilities, adds them to the *DATA* column
   -  **sm.predict** for any value of incremental then sets
      *CORRECTED_DATA* equal to *DATA*, and *MODEL_DATA* to 1
   
   Numerous methods to facilitate dealing with antenna configuration
   files, geodetic conversions, mosaic pointing files, etc, can also
   be found in the simutil class.
