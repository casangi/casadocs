Description
   specfit task: Fit 1-dimensional gaussians/lorentzians and/or
   polynomial models to an image or image region
   
   Simultaneously performs a non-linear, least squares fit using the
   Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm of one or more Gaussian singlets,
   one or more Lorentzian singlets, one or more Gaussian multiplets,
   and/or a polynomial to one dimensional spectral profiles. A
   description of the fitting algorithm may be found in AIPS++ Note
   224 [1]_ and in Numerical Recipes [2]_ . A
   Gaussian/Lorentzian singlet is a Gaussian/Lorentzian function
   whose parameters (amplitude, center position, and width) are all
   independent from any other parameters that may be simultaneously
   fit. A Gaussian multiplet is a set of two or more Gaussian
   functions in which at least one (and possibly two or three) of the
   parameters of each function depend on the parameters of another,
   single, reference function in the multiplet. For example: one can
   specify a doublet in which the amplitude of the first spectral
   line is 0.6 times the amplitude of the zeroth (reference) spectral
   line, and/or the center of the first line is 20 pixels from the
   center of the zeroth line, and/or the fwhm of the first line is
   identical (in pixels) to that of the zeroth line. There is no
   limit to the number of components one can specify for a multiplet,
   except of course that the number of parameters to be fit should be
   significantly less than the number of data points. There can only
   be a single reference profile in a multiplet, to which the
   parameters of the other component profiles in the multiplet are
   tied to.
   
   .. rubric:: AXIS
   
   The *axis* parameter indicates along which axis the profiles
   should be fit; a negative value indicates that the spectral axis
   should be used, or if one does not exist, that the zeroth axis
   should be used.
   
   .. rubric:: MINIMUM NUMBER OF PIXELS
   
   The *minpts* parameter indicates the minimum number of unmasked
   pixels that must be present in order for a fit to be attempted.
   When *multifit=True*, positions with too few good points will be
   masked in any output images.
   
   .. rubric:: ONE FIT OF REGION AVERAGE OR PIXEL BY PIXEL FIT
   
   The *multifit* parameter indicates if profiles should be fit at
   each pixel position in the selected region (true), or if the
   spectral profiles in that region should be averaged together and
   the fit done to that averaged spectral profile (false).
   
   .. rubric:: POLYNOMIAL FITTING
   
   The order of the polynomial to fit is specified via the *poly*
   parameter. If *poly<0*, no polynomial fit will be attempted. No
   initial estimates of coefficients can be specified; these are
   determined automatically.
   
   .. rubric:: Gaussian SINGLET FITTING
   
   The *ngauss* parameter specifies the maximum number of Gaussian
   singlets to be fitted, if no estimates are specified by the
   profile's initial parameter estimates pampest, pcenterest and
   pfwhmest (the so-called *p\*est* parameters) or by
   an estimates file, and if gmncomps=0 or is empty. The initial
   estimates of the parameters for these Gaussians will be
   determined automatically in this case. If it deems it appropriate,
   the fitter will fit fewer Gaussians than this number.  If
   the *estimates* parameter is not specified, or the *p*est*
   parameters are not specified and *ngauss=0*, *gmncomps* is empty
   or 0, and *poly<0*, an error will occur as this indicates there is
   nothing to fit.
   
   One can specify initial estimates of Gaussian singlet parameters
   via an estimates file or the *pampest*, *pcenterest*, *pfwhmest*,
   and optionally, the *pfix* parameters. The latter is the
   recommended way to specify these estimates as support for
   estimates files may be deprecated in the future. No matter which
   option is used, an amplitude initial estimate must always be
   nonzero. A negative fwhm estimate will be silently changed to
   positve.
   
   .. rubric:: SPECIFYING INITIAL ESTIMATES FOR Gaussian AND
      Lorentzian SINGLETS (RECOMMENDED METHOD)
   
   One may specify initial estimates via the *pampest*, *pcenterest*,
   and *pfwhmest* parameters. In the case of a single Gaussian or
   Lorentzian singlet, these parameters can be scalar numbers.
   *pampest* must be specified in image brightness units,
   *pcenterest* must be given in the number of pixels from the zeroth
   pixel, and *pfwhmest* must be given in pixels. Optionally *pfix*
   can be specified and in the case of a single Gaussian or
   Lorentzian singlet, it can be a string. The string indicates which
   parameters should be held constant during the fit. Any combination
   of "p" (amplitude), "c" (center), or "f" (fwhm) is allowed; e.g.
   *pfix="pc"* means fix both the amplitude and center of a
   Gaussian/Lorentzian profile during the fit. In the case of more
   than one Gaussian and/or Lorentzian singlets, these parameters
   must be specified as arrays of numbers. The length of the arrays
   indicates the number of singlets to fit and the array length must
   be the same for all the *p*est* parameters.
   
   If no parameters are to be fixed for any of the singlets, *pfix*
   can be set to the empty string. However, if at least one parameter
   of one singlet is to be fixed, *pfix* must be an array of strings
   and have a length equal to that of the *p*est* arrays. Singlets
   which are not to have any parameters fixed should be represented
   as an empty string in the *pfix* array. So, for example, if one
   desires to fit three singlets and fix the fwhm of the middle one,
   one must specify *pfix=["", "f", ""]*, the other two empty strings
   indicating that no parameters of the zeroth and second singlet
   should be held constant.
   
   In the case of *multifit=True*, the initial estimates, whether
   from the *p*est* parameters or from a file (see below), will be
   applied to the location of the first fit. This is normally the
   bottom left corner of the region selected. If the region is
   masked, or does not contain enough good points to perform a fit,
   or if the attempted fit fails, the fitting proceeds to the next
   pixel, with the pixel value of the lowest numbered axis changing
   the fastest. Once a successful fit has been performed, subsequent
   fits will use the results of the fit of a nearest pixel, for which
   a previous fit was successful, as the initial estimates for the
   parameters at the current location. The fixed parameter string
   *pfix* will be honored for every fit performed when
   *multifit=True*.
   
   One specifies what type of PCF profile to fit via the *pfunc*
   parameter. A PCF function is one that can be parameterized by a
   peak, center, and FWHM, as both Gaussian and Lorentzian singlets
   can. If all singlets to be fit are Gaussians, one can set *pfunc*
   equal to the empty string and all snglets will be assumed to be
   Gaussians. If at least one Lorentzian is to be fit, *pfunc* must
   be specified as a string (in the case of a single singlet) or an
   array of strings (in the case of multiple singlets). The position
   of each string corresponds to the positions of the initial
   estimates in the *p*est* and *pfix* arrays. Minimal match ("g",
   "G", "l", or "L") is supported. So, if one wanted to
   simultaneously fit two Gaussian and two Lorentzian singlets, the
   zeroth and last of which were Lorentzians, one would specify
   *pfunc=["L", "G", "G", "L"]*.
   
   .. rubric:: ESTIMATES FILE FOR Gaussian SINGLETS (NONRECOMMENDED METHOD)

   Initial estimates for Gaussian singlets can be specified in an
   estimates file via the *estimates* parameter, which contains the
   name of the file. Estimates files may be deprecated in the future
   in favor of the *p*est* parameters, so it is recommended users use
   those parameters instead. To use an estimates file, the *p*est*
   parameters must be 0 or empty and *mgncomps* must be 0 or empty.
   Only Gaussian singlets can be specified in an estimates file. If
   one desires to fit one or more Gaussian multiplets and/or one or
   more Lorentzian singlets simultaneously, the *p*est* parameters
   must be used to specify the initial parameters of all Gaussian
   singlets to fit; one cannot use an estimates file in this case. If
   an estimates file is specified, a polynomial can be fit
   simultaneously by specifying the *poly* parameter. The estimates
   file must contain initial estimates of parameters for all Gaussian
   singlets to be fit. The number of Gaussian singlets to fit is
   given by the number of estimate input lines in the file. The file
   can contain comments which are indicated by a "#" at the beginning
   of a line. All non-comment lines will be interpreted as initial
   estimates. The format of such a line is:
   
   [peak intensity], [center], [fwhm], [optional fixed parameter
   string]
   
   The first three values are required and must be numerical values.
   The peak intensity must be expressed in image brightness units,
   while the center must be specified in pixels offset from the
   zeroth pixel, and fwhm must be specified in pixels. The fourth
   value is a character string and it is optional. If present, it
   represents the parameter(s) that should be held constant during
   the fit. Any combination of the characters 'p' (peak), 'c'
   (center), and 'f' (fwhm) are permitted, e.g. "fc" means hold the
   fwhm and the center constant during the fit. Fixed parameters will
   have no errors associated with them. Here is an example file:
   
   ::
   
      # estimates file indicating that two Gaussians should be fit
      # first Gaussian estimate, peak=40, center at pixel number
      #  10.5, fwhm = 5.8 pixels, all parameters allowed to vary during
      # fit 40, 10.5, 5.8

      # second Gaussian, peak = 4, center at pixel number 90.2,
      # fwhm = 7.2 pixels, hold fwhm constant 4, 90.2, 7.2, f
      # end file
   
   .. rubric:: Gaussian MULTIPLET FITTING
   
   Any number of Gaussian multiplets, each containing any number of
   two or more components, can be simultaneously fit, optionally with
   a polynomial and/or any number of Gaussian and/or Lorentzian
   singlets, the only caveat being that the number of parameters to
   be fit should be significantly less than the number of data
   points. The *gmncomps* parameter indicates the number of
   multiplets to fit and the number of components in each multiplet.
   In the case of a single multiplet, an integer (>1) can be
   specified. For example, *mgncomps=4* means fit a single quadruplet
   of Gaussians. In the case of 2 or more multiplets, an array of
   integers (all >1) must be specified. For example, *gmncomps=[2, 4,
   3]* means 3 separate multiples are to be fit, the zeroth being a
   doublet, the first being a quadruplet, and the second being a
   triplet.
   
   Initial estimates of all Gaussians in all multiplets are specified
   via gmampest, gmcenterest, and gmfwhmest (the so-called *gm*est*
   parameters) `[b] <#fnb>`__ parameters, which must be arrays of
   numbers. The input order starts with the zeroth component of the
   zeroth multiplet to the last component of the zeroth multiplet,
   then the zeroth component of the first multiplet to the last
   component of the first multiplet, etc to the zeroth component of
   the last multiplet to the last element of the last multiplet. The
   zeroth element of a multiplet is defined as the reference
   component of that multiplet and has the special significance that
   it is the profile to which all constraints of all other profiles
   in that multiplet are referenced (see below). So, in our example
   of *gmncomps=[2, 4, 3]* **,** *gmampest*, *gmcenterest*, and
   *gmfwhmest* must each be nine (the total number of individual
   Gaussian profiles summed over all multiplets) element arrays. The
   zeroth, second, and sixth elements represent parameters of the
   reference profiles in the zeroth, first, and second multiplet,
   respectively.
   
   The fixed relationships between the non-reference profile(s) and
   the reference profile of a multiplet are specified via the
   *gmampcon*, *gmcentercon*, and *gmfwhmcon* parameters. At least
   one, and any combination, of constraints can be specified for any
   non-reference component of a multiplet. The amplitude ratio of a
   non-reference line to that of the reference line is set in
   *gmampcon*. The ratio of the fwhm of a non-reference line to that
   of the reference line is set in *gmfwhmcon*. The offset in pixels
   of the center position of a non-reference line to that of the
   reference line is set in *gmcentercon*. In the case where a
   parameter is not constrained for any non-reference line of any
   multiplet, the value of the associated parameter must be 0. In the
   case of a single doublet, a constraint may be specified as a
   number or an array of a single number. For example, *mgncomps=2*
   and *gmampcon=0.65* and *gmcentercon=[32.4]* means there is a
   single doublet to fit where the amplitude ratio of the first to
   the zeroth line is constained to be 0.65 and the center of the
   first line is constrained to be offset by 32.4 pixels from the
   center of the zeroth line. In cases of a total of three or more
   Gaussians, the constraints parameters must be specified as arrays
   with lengths equal to the total number of Gaussians summed over
   all multiplets minus the number of reference lines (one per
   multiplet, or just number of multiplets, since reference lines
   cannot be constrained by themselves). In the cases where an array
   must be specified but a component in that array does not have that
   constraint, 0 should be specified. Here's an example:
   
   ::
   
      gmncomps=[2, 4, 3]
      gmampcon= [ 0 , 0.2, 0 , 0.1, 4.5, 0 ]
      gcentercon=[24.2, 45.6, 92.7, 0 , -22.8, -33.5]
      gfwhmcon=""
   
   In this case we have our previous example of one doublet, one
   quadruplet, and one triplet. The first component of the doublet
   has the constraint that its center is offset by 24.2 pixels from
   the zeroth (reference) component. The first component of the
   quadruplet is constrained to have an amplitude of 0.2 times that
   of the quadruplet's zeroth component and its center is constrained
   to be offset by 45.6 pixels from the reference component. The
   second component of the quadruplet is constained to have its
   center offset by 92.7 pixels from the associated reference
   component and the third component is constrained to have an
   amplitude of 0.1 times that of the associated reference component.
   The first component of the triplet is constrained to have an
   amplitude of 4.5 times that of its associated reference component
   and its center is constrained to be offset by -22.8 pixels from
   the reference component's center. The second component of the
   triplet is constrained to have its center offset by -33.5 pixels
   from the center of the reference component. No lines have FWHM
   constraints, so the empty string can be given for that parameter.
   Note that using 0 to indicate no constraint for line center means
   that one cannot specify a line centered at the same position as
   the reference component but having a different FWHM from the
   reference component. If you must specify this very unusual case,
   try using a very small positive (or even negative) value for the
   center constraint.
   
   Note that when a parameter for a line is constrained, the
   corresponding value for that component in the corresponding
   *gm*est* array is ignored and the value of the constrained
   parameter is automatically used instead. So let's say, for our
   example above, we had specified the following estimates:
   
   ::
   
      gmampest = [ 1, .2, 2, .1, .1, .5, 3, 2, 5]
      gmcenterest = [20, 10 , 30, 45.2, 609 , -233, 30, -859, 1]
   
   Before any fitting is done, the constraints would be taken into
   account and these arrays would be implicitly rewritten as:
   
   ::
   
      gmampest = [ 1, .2, 2, .4, .1, .2, 3, 13.5, 5 ]
      gmcenterest = [20, 44.2, 30, 75.6, 127.7, -233, 30, 7.2, -3.5]
   
   The value of *gmfwhmest* would be unchanged since there are no
   FWHM constraints in this example.
   
   In addition to be constrained by values of the reference
   component, parameters of individual components can be fixed. Fixed
   parameters are specified via the *gmfix* parameter. If no
   parameters are to be fixed, *gmfix* can be specified as the empty
   string or a zero element array. In the case where any parameter is
   to be fixed, *gmfix* must be specified as an array of strings with
   length equal to the total number of components summed over all
   multiplets. These strings encode which parameters to be fixed for
   the corresponding components. If a component is to have no
   parameters fixed, an empty string is used. In other cases one or
   more of any combination of parameters can be fixed using "p", "c",
   and/or "f" described above for fixing singlet parameters. There
   are a couple of special cases to be aware of. In the case where a
   non-reference component parameter is constrained and the
   corresponding reference component parameter is set as fixed, that
   parameter in the non-reference parameter will automatically be
   fixed even if it was specified not to be fixed in the *gmfix*
   array. This is the only way the constraint can be honored after
   all. In the converse case of when a constrained parameter of a
   non-reference component is specified as fixed, but the
   corresponding parameter in the reference component is not
   specified to be fixed, an error will occur. Fixing an
   unconstrained parameter in a non-reference component is always
   legal, as is fixing any combination of parameters in a reference
   component (with the above caveat that corresponding constrained
   parameters in non-reference components will be silently held fixed
   as well).
   
   The same rules that apply to singlets when *multifit=True* apply
   to multiplets.
   
   .. rubric:: LIMITING RANGES FOR SOLUTION PARAMETERS
   
   In cases of low (or no) signal to noise spectra, it is still
   possible for the fit to converge, but often to a nonsensical
   solution. The astronomer can use her knowledge of the source to
   filter out obviously spurious solutions. Any solution which
   contains a NaN value as a value or error in any one of its
   parameters is automatically marked as invalid.
   
   One can also limit the ranges of solution parameters to known
   "good" values via the goodamprange, goodcenterrange, and
   goodfwhmrange parameters. Any combination can be specified and the
   limit constraints will be ANDed together. The ranges apply to all
   PCF components that might be fit; choosing ranges on a component
   by component basis is not supported. If specified, an array of
   exactly two numerical values must be given to indicate the range
   of acceptable solution values for that parameter. *goodamprange*
   is expressed in terms of image brightness units. *goodcenterrange*
   is expressed in terms of pixels from the zeroth pixel in the
   specified region. *goodfwhmrange* is expressed in terms of pixels
   (only non-negative values should be given for FWHM range
   endpoints). In the case of a multiple-PCF fit, if any of the
   corresponding solutions are outside the specified ranges, the
   entire solution is considered to be invalid.
   
   In addition, solutions for which the absolute value of the ratio
   of the amplitude error to the amplitude exceeds 100 or the ratio
   of the FWHM error to the FWHM exceeds 100 are automatically marked
   as invalid.
   
   .. rubric:: INCLUDING STANDARD DEVIATIONS OF PIXEL VALUES
   
   If the standard deviations of the pixel values in the input image
   are known and they vary in the image (e.g. they are higher for
   pixels near the edge of the band), they can be included in the
   *sigma* parameter. This parameter takes either an array or an
   image name. The array or image must have one of three shapes:
   
   #. the shape of the input image,
   #. the same dimensions as the input image with the lengths of all
      axes being one except for the fit axis which must have length
      corresponding to its length in the input image, or
   #. be one dimensional with length equal the the length of the fit
      axis in the input image.
   
   In cases 2 and 3, the array or pixels in sigma will be replicated
   such that the image that is ultimately used is the same shape as
   the input image. The values of sigma must be non-negative. It is
   only the relative values that are important. A value of 0 means
   that pixel should not be used in the fit. Other than that, if
   pixel A has a higher standard deviation than pixel B, then pixel A
   is noisier than pixel B and will receive a lower weight when the
   fit is done. The weight of a pixel is the usual:
   
   weight = :math:`\frac{1}{\sigma^2}`
   
   In the case of *multifit=F*, the sigma values at each pixel along
   the fit axis in the hyperplane perpendicular to the fit axis which
   includes that pixel are averaged and the resultant averaged
   standard deviation spectrum is the one used in the fit.
   Internally, sigma values are normalized such that the maximum
   value is 1. This mitigates a known overflow issue.
   
   One can write the normalized standard deviation image used in the
   fit but specifying its name in *outsigma*. This image can then be
   used as *sigma* for subsequent runs.
   
   .. rubric:: RETURNED DICTIONARY STRUCTURE
   
   The dictionary returned (if *wantreturn=True*) has a (necessarily)
   complex structure. First, there are keys "xUnit" and "yUnit" whose
   values are the abscissa unit and the ordinate unit described by
   simple strings. Next there are arrays giving a broad overview of
   the fit quality. These arrays have the shape of the specified
   region collapsed along the fit axis with the axis corresponding to
   the fit axis having length of 1:
   
   -  ATTEMPTED: a boolean array indicating which fits were attempted
      (e.g. if too few unmasked points, a fit will not be attempted)
   -  CONVERGED: a boolean array indicating which fits converged.
      False if the fit was not attempted
   -  VALID: a boolean array indicating which solutions fall within
      the specified valid ranges of parameter space (see section
      **LIMITING RANGES FOR SOLUTION PARAMETERS** for details)
   -  NITER: an int array indicating the number of iterations for
      each profile, a negative value indicates the fit did not
      converge
   -  NCOMPS: the number of components (Gaussian singlets +
      Lorentzian singlets + Gaussian multiplets + polynomial) fit for
      the profile, a negative value indicates the fit did not
      converge
   -  DIRECTION: a string array containing the world direction
      coordinate for each profile
   
   There is a "type" array having number of dimensions equal to the
   number of dimensions in the above arrays plus one. The shape of
   the first n-1 dimensions is the same as the shape of the above
   arrays. The length of the last dimension is equal to the number of
   components fit. The values of this array are strings describing
   the components that were fit at each position ("POLYNOMIAL",
   "Gaussian" in the case of Gaussian singlets, "Lorentzian" in the
   case of Lorentzian singlets, and ""Gaussian MULTPLET").
   
   If any Gaussian singlets were fit, there will be a subdictionary
   accessible via the "gs" key which will have subkeys "amp",
   "ampErr", "center", "centerErr", "fwhm", "fwhmErr, "integral", and
   "integralErr". Each of these arrays will have one more dimension
   than the overview arrays described above. The shape of the first
   n-1 dimensions will be the same as the shape of the arrays
   described above, while the final dimension will have length equal
   to the maximum number of Gaussian singlets that were fit. Along
   this axis will be the corresponding fit result or associated error
   (depending on the array's associated key) of the fit for that
   singlet component number. In cases where the fit did not converge,
   or that particular component was excluded from the fit, a value of
   NAN will be present.
   
   If any Lorentzian singlets were fit, their solutions will be
   accessible via the "ls" key. These arrays follow the same rules as
   the "gs" arrays described above.
   
   If any Gaussian multiplets were fit, there will be subdictionaries
   accessible by keys "gm0", "gm1", ..., "gm{n-1}" where n is the
   number of Gaussian muliplets that were fit. Each of these
   dictionaries will have the same arrays described above for
   Gaussian singlets. The last dimension will have length equal to
   the number of components in that particular multiplet. Each pixel
   along the last axis will be the parameter solution value or error
   for that component number in the multiplet, e.g. the zeroth pixel
   along that axis contains the parameter solution or error for the
   reference component of the multiplet.
   
   The polynomial coefficient solutions and errors are not returned,
   although they are logged.
   
   .. rubric:: OUTPUT IMAGES
   
   In addition to the returned dictionary, optionally one or more of
   any combination of output images can be written. The *model* and
   *residual* parameters indicate the names of the model and residual
   images to be written; blank values inidcate that these images
   should not be written.
   
   One can also write none, any or all of the solution and error
   images for Gaussian singlet, Lorentzian singlet, and Gaussian
   multiplet fits via the parameters *amp*, *amperr*, *center*,
   *centererr*, *fwhm*, *fwhmerr*, *integral*, and *integralerr* when
   doing multi-pixel fits. These images simply contain the arrays
   described for the associated parameter solutions or errors
   described in previous sections. In the case of Lorentzian
   singlets, "_ls" is appended to the image names, in the case of
   Gaussian multiplets, "_gm" is appended. Pixels for which fits were
   not attempted or did not converge will be masked as bad. The last
   axis of these images is a linear axis and repesents component
   number (and is named accordingly). In the case where multiple
   Gaussian singlets and/or Lorentzians are fitted, the image names
   are further appended with an underscore and the relevant component
   number ("_0", "_1", etc). In the case of Gaussian multiplets, the
   image names are appended with an underscore, followed by the
   number of the relevant multiplet group, followed by an underscore,
   followed by the number of the component in that group (e.g.,
   "image_gm_3_4" represents component number 4 of multiplet group
   number 3). Pixels for which fits were not attempted, did not
   converge, or converged but have values of NaN (not a number) or
   INF (infinity) will be masked as bad.
   
   Writing analogous images for polynomial coefficients is not
   supported.
