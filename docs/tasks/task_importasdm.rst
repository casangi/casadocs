Description
   .. note:: NOTE: **importevla** has now been deprecated, and
      **importasdm** combined with **flagdata** should be used to
      import JVLA data, as explained in a dedicated section below.

   The **importasdm** task will fill SDM1.2 and SDM1.3 format data
   into a CASA visibility data set (MS). The importasdm task supports
   all changes in the ALMA ASDM made since the previous CASA release
   (an up-to-date description of the most recent tables of the SDM
   can be found
   `here <../../notebooks/casa-fundamentals.ipynb#Science-Data-Model>`__).
   ALMA data were recorded in SDM1.2 format from October 2009 until
   May 2011. Since May 2011, ALMA is using the SDM1.3 format. In
   particular, all science data from Cycle 0 onward will be in
   SDM1.3. The JVLA started using SDM1.2 in October 2009, but
   currently also uses SDM1.3. The **importasdm** task can read all
   of the above formats.  For the default parameter settings for
   **importasdm**, see the Examples tab.
   
   The basic modes of importing data utilizing **importasdm** can be
   set by using various parameters.  For example,
   
   -  If the parameter *scans* is set, then **importasdm** processes
      only the scans specified in the option’s value. This value is a
      semicolon-separated list of scan specifications. A scan
      specification consists in an execution (exec) block index
      followed by the character ’:’ followed by a comma-separated
      list of scan indices or scan index ranges. A scan index is
      relative to the exec block it belongs to. Scan indices are
      1-based while exec blocks are 0-based. The expressions:
   
      -  "0:1"
      -  "2:2~6"
      -  "0:1;1:2~6,8;2:,3:24~30"
      -  "1,2"
      -  "3:"
   
   -  are all valid values for the selection. The "3:" selector will
      be interpreted as ’all the scans of the exec block 3’. A scan
      index or a scan index range not preceded by an exec block index
      will be interpreted as ’all the scans with such indexes in all
      the exec blocks’. By default, all the scans are considered.
   -  When *process_flags=True*, the task will create online flags
      based on the Flag.xml, Antenna.xml and SpectralWindow.xml files
      and copy them to the *FLAG_CMD* sub-table of the MS. The flags
      will NOT be applied unless the parameter *applyflags* is set to
      True. Optionally, the flags can also be saved to an external
      ASCII file if *savecmds* is set to True. The flags can later be
      applied to the MS using task **flagdata** in list mode.
   -  When *bdfflags=True*, the task will apply online flags
      contained in the ASDM BDF data by calling the executable
      bdflags2MS which the user can also do from the OS prompt.
      Setting *bdfflags=True* is recommended for ALMA data.
   -  When *createmms=True*, the task will create a Multi-MS
      partitioned according to the given separation axis. For more
      detailed documentation on partition, Multi-MS, and the MPI use
      in CASA, please see the global task list pages describing
      **partition** and **mstransform**. `The
      Multi-MS <../../notebooks/parallel-processing.ipynb#The-Multi-MS>`__ also
      contains more information on Multi-MS creation. 
   -  When setting the values for *wvr_corrected_data*, the task will
      read the SDM binary data and fill the DATA column in the MAIN
      table of the MS for those ALMA data that have either corrected
      data, uncorrected data or both. Expected values for this option
      are 'no' for the uncorrected data (this is the default), 'yes'
      for the corrected data, and 'both' for corrected and
      uncorrected data. In the latter case, two MeasurementSets are
      created, one containing the uncorrected data and the other
      containing the corrected data; the name of the corrected
      MS will be given a suffix of '-wvr-corrected'. See the relevent
      documentation on the ALMA Science Portal regarding those ALMA
      cycles which provided both corrected and uncorrected data
      streams.
   
   .. rubric:: Import of JVLA data with importasdm
   
   As of CASA 5.4, the task importevla is no longer available to
   import JVLA data. The functionality is replaced by importasdm,
   which is also being used by the VLA pipeline. However, several
   additional steps are required to duplicate the behaviour of
   importevla when using importasdm, involving a difference in
   default parameters and the fact that some of the on-the-go
   flagging cannot be performed by importasdm.
   
   To mimic the behaviour of importevla, change the following
   parameters in **importasdm** from their default settings:
   
   -  *ocorr_mode = 'co'* to import cross-correlations only
      (discarding auto-correlations) *
      *
   -  *with_pointing_correction = True* to add pointing
      corrections *
      *
   -  *process_flags = True* (default) to read in the online flags,
      then *applyflags = True* to apply the online flags and/or
      *savecmd = True* to save flag commands to an ascii table **.**
   -  For ephemeris objects: convert_ephem2geo = False
   
   While online flags can thus be created by leaving the parameter
   *process_flags = True* by default, additional flagging steps need
   to be performed after **importasdm** to flag zero values and
   shadowing of antennas:
   
   -  **Shadow flags:** use task **flagdata**, with *mode = 'shadow'*
      (and optionally *reason = 'shadow'*). The parameters
      *tolerance* and *addantenna* can be specified in flagdata in
      the same way they were used in importevla. *
      *
   -  **Zero clipping flags:** use task **flagdata**, with *mode =
      'clip',* *correlation = 'ABS_ALL',* and *clipzeros = True* (and
      optionally *reason = 'clip'*) *.* Note that the non-default
      case in importevla where *flagpol = False c* an be replicated
      by setting *correlation="ABS_RR, ABS_LL".*
   
   Like **importasdm**, the task **flagdata** can also save the
   flagging commands to an ascii table by setting *savepars = True.*
   To NOT apply the flags (*applyflags=False* in importevla) add
   *action='calculate'* to flagdata. You may also chose to add a
   reason using the cmdreason argument, e.g.
   *cmdreason="CLIP_ZERO_ALL".*
   
   .. warning:: **WARNING**: The task **flagdata** can only write out the
      flag commands for that invocation of flagdata. The default
      *overwrite=True* must be used to overwrite an existing file. In
      order to save the commands from all 3 possible flagging steps
      (importasdm, zero, and shadow) each step must be saved to a
      separate file, which must then be concatenated into a single
      file to be used to flag the data.
   
   .. rubric:: Import of ASDM data with option *lazy=True*
   
   For the parameter *lazy*, if the default value False is chosen,
   **importasdm** will fill the visibilities into a newly created
   DATA column (FLOAT_DATA for total power data) of the MS converting
   them from their binary format in the ASDM to the CASA Table
   format. If *lazy* is set to True, the task will create the
   DATA/FLOAT_DATA column with an ASDM-specific storage manager, the
   (asdmstman), which enables CASA to directly read the binary data
   from the ASDM with on-the-fly conversion. No redundant copy of the
   raw data is created.
   
   This procedure has the advantage that it saves more than 60% disk
   space and at least in some cases makes the access to the DATA
   column ≥ 10% faster because the data I/O volume is decreased. For
   the same reason, it also accelerates the import itself by ca. a
   factor 2. The acceleration is particularly large in the
   **applycal** task and here particularly on standard SATA disks.
   E.g., if your ASDM has a size of 36 GB, the import with default
   parameters will turn this into an MS of 73 GB size (total disk
   space consumption = 36 GB + 73 GB = 109 GB). With *lazy=True*, the
   imported MS has a size of only 2 GB (total disk space consumption
   = 36 GB + 2 GB = 38 GB). I.e. your total disk space savings are
   ca. 65%. Even when you compare to the case where you delete the
   ASDM after normal import, the solution with lazy import and
   keeping the ASDM will save you ca. 48% disk space (in the example
   above 38 GB compared to 73 GB). The only caveats are the
   following:
   
   #. You must not delete your ASDM. You can, however, move it but
      you have to update the reference stored in the MS. Symbolic
      links will work. See below on how to use the tool method
      **ms.asdmref** to manipulate the ASDM reference.
   #. The lazily imported DATA/FLOAT_DATA column is read-only. But in
      any normal data reduction, the DATA/FLOAT_DATA column (as
      opposed to CORRECTED DATA) is treated as read-only anyway.
   
   The lazily imported MS is numerically identical with the
   traditionally imported MS and so are all results derived from the
   MSs. The setting *lazy=True* might be made the default setting in
   future CASA releases. An important additional tool to manipulate
   lazily imported MSs is the method **ms.asdmref** in the MS tool.
   If the MS is imported from an ASDM with option *lazy=True*, the
   DATA/FLOAT_DATA column of the MS is virtual and directly reads the
   visibilities from the ASDM. A reference to the original ASDM is
   stored with the MS. If the ASDM needs to be moved to a different
   path, the reference to it in the MS needs to be updated. This can
   be achieved with **ms.asdmref**. The method takes one argument:
   *abspath*. When called with *abspath* equal to an empty string
   (default), the method just reports the currently set ASDM path or
   an empty string if the ASDM path was not set, i.e. the MS was not
   lazily imported. If you want to move the referenced ASDM to a
   different path, you can set the new absolute path by providing it
   as the value of *abspath* to the method.
   
   ::
   
      ms.open(’uid___A12345_X678_X910.ms’,False)
      ms.asdmref(’/home/alma/myanalysis/uid___A12345_X678_X910’)
      ms.close()
   
   will set the new location of the referenced ASDM to
   /home/alma/myanalysis/uid___A12345_X678_X910.
   
   .. note:: **NOTE**: The lazily imported MS can be moved without any
      restrictions independently from the referenced ASDM as long as
      the absolute path to the ASDM remains accessible, even across
      file systems.
   

.. _Examples:

Examples
   In the simplest form, setting bdfflags=True and verbose=True:
   
   ::
   
      importasdm(asdm='uid___A002_Xbbadbe_X88ec.asdm.sdm',
                 vis='uid___A002_Xbbadbe_X88ec.ms', bdfflags=True, verbose=True)

   
   Import both the corrected and uncorrected WVR data from an ALMA
   dataset with wvr_corrected_data='both' and setting bdfflags=True
   and verbose=True:
   
   ::
   
      importasdm(asdm='uid___A002_Xbbadbe_X88ec.asdm.sdm',
                 vis='uid___A002_Xbbadbe_X88ec.ms', wvr_corrected_data='both',
                 bdfflags=True, verbose=True)
   
   In this case, two MeasurementSets are created, one with
   WVR-uncorrected data filled in the MAIN table and the other with
   WVR-corrected data filled in the MAIN table.

   
   To import data from the VLA (and replicate the behaviour of the
   deprecated task **importevla**):
   
   ::
   
      importasdm(asdm='19A-119.sb123243.58235.79924266203',
                 vis='19A-119.sb123243.58235.79924266203.ms', ocorr_mode='co',
                 with_pointing_correction=True, process_flags=True)
   
      flagdata(vis='19A-119.sb123243.58235.79924266203.ms',
               mode='shadow')
   
      flagdata(vis='19A-119.sb123243.58235.79924266203.ms',
               mode='clip', correlation='ABS_ALL', and clipzeros=True)
   
   Note that while online flags can thus be created by leaving the
   parameter *process_flags = True* by default, the additional
   flagging steps need to be performed after **importasdm** to flag
   zero values and shadowing of antennas, in order to replicate the
   behavior of the deprecated task **importevla**. See the CASA Docs
   pages on `importing
   (u,v)-data <../../notebooks/visibilities_import_export.ipynb#UV-Data-Import>`__
