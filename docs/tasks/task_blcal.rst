Description
   The **blcal** task determines baseline-based time- and/or
   frequency-dependent gains for all baselines in the data set. Such
   solutions are in contrast to **gaincal** and **bandpass**
   solutions which are antenna-based and better constrained.
   
   .. note:: In general, solving for and applying baseline-based calibration
      can be a very dangerous thing to do, since such non-closing
      corrections can fundamentally alter the otherwise unique source
      structure information obtained by an interferometer. Use of
      **blcal** should be approached with great care, after all
      antenna-based calibration options have been exhausted, and then
      only on long timescales, to ensure that the solution doesn't
      absorb true---or reinforce false---source structure. You must
      be sure you have an excellent model for the source (better than
      the magnitude of the baseline-dependent errors). In any case,
      **blcal** will, if used, usually mark the endpoint of a
      calibration scheme, reinforcing the current source model, and
      rendering any additional antenna-based calibration (e.g.,
      selfcal) less reliable. As such, it could be viewed as a mostly
      cosmetic last step in calibration.
   
   .. rubric:: Common calibration solve parameters

   The **blcal** task uses all of the same parameters as gaincal and
   bandpass, which the exception of gaintype and bandtype,
   respectively. See `"Solving for
   Calibration" <../../notebooks/synthesis_calibration.ipynb#Solve-for-Calibration>`__
   for general information about calibration solving parameters.
   
   .. rubric:: Controlling frequency-dependence in blcal: *freqdep*
   
   The parameter *freqdep* controls whether or not a
   channel-dependent solution should be obtained. If *freqdep=True*,
   a channelized solution (like **bandpass**, but baseline-based)
   will be obtained; otherwise the solution will be unchannelized
   (like **gaincal**, but baseline-based).

Examples
   In this example, we solve for constant (*solint='inf'*)
   frequency-independent (*freqdep=False*) baseline-based solutions
   relative to ordinary gain, bandpass, and gaincurve calibration:
   
   ::
   
      blcal(vis='data.ms',
            caltable='cal.M',                        # Output table name
            field='2',                               # A field with a very good model
            solint='inf',                            # single solution per baseline, spw
            gaintable=['cal.B','cal.gc','cal.G90s'], # all prior cal
            freqdep=False)                           # frequency-independent solution
