Description
   This task performs a Fourier-based convolution to 'smooth' the
   direction plane of an image. Smoothing is typically performed in
   order to reduce the noise in an image.
   
   A deconvolved image :math:`\bf{I}` can be smoothed to a target
   resolution by convolving it with a `Gaussian
   beam <../../notebooks/casa-fundamentals.ipynb#Definition-Synthesized-Beam>`__
   :math:`\bf{B}_{\rm tar}`. If the image is already convolved with
   another smaller beam :math:`\bf{B}_{\rm cur}` a correcting beam
   :math:`\bf{B}_{\rm cor}` can be calculated so that

   .. math:: \begin{align} \bf{B}_{\rm tar} * \bf{I} = \bf{B}_{\rm cor} * (\bf{B}_{\rm cur} * \bf{I}),  \end{align}

   where :math:`*` is the convolution operator.  The Fourier
   transform of the above equation is

   .. math:: \begin{align} \bf{B}_{\rm tar}^f  \bf{I}^f = \bf{B}_{\rm cor}^f  (\bf{B}_{\rm cur}^f  \bf{I}^f), \end{align}
   
   where the superscript :math:`f` indicates the Fourier transform.
   The correcting beam can then be obtained by

   .. math:: \begin{align} \bf{B}_{\rm cor} = \mathcal{F}^{-1} \left( \frac{\bf{B}_{\rm tar}^f}{\bf{B}_{\rm cur}^f} \right). \end{align}

   Below we provide details of how the task imsmooth implements this
   concept.
   
   .. rubric:: Gaussian Kernel
   
   The direction pixels must be square. If they are not, use imregrid
   to regrid your image onto a grid of square pixels.
   
   Under the hood, **ia.convolve2d()** is called with *scale=-1*
   (auto scaling). This means that, when the input image has a
   restoring beam, pixel values in the output image are scaled in
   such a way as to conserve flux density.
   
   *major* and *minor* are the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of
   the Gaussian. *pa* is the position angle of the Gaussian.
   
   The beam parameter offers an alternate way of describing the
   convolving Gaussian. If used, neither *major*, *minor*, nor *pa*
   can be specified. The beam parameter must have exactly three
   fields: "*major*", "*minor*", and "*pa*" (or "positionangle");
   this is the record format for the output of
   **ia.restoringbeam()**. For example: 
   
   beam = {"major": "5arcsec", "minor": "2arcsec", "pa": "20deg"} 
   
   If both beam and any of *major*, *minor*, and/or *pa* are
   specified for a Gaussian kernel, an exception will be thrown.
   
   Alternatively, if the input image has multiple beams, setting
   *kernel='commonbeam'* will result in the smallest area beam that
   encloses all beams in the image to be used as the target
   resolution to which to convolve all planes.
   
   In addition, the *targetres* parameter indicates if the specified
   Gaussian is to be the resolution of the final image (*True*) or if
   it is to be used to convolve the input image (*False*). If *True*,
   the input image must have a restoring beam. Use **imhead()** or
   **ia.restoringbeam()** to check for its existence. If the image
   has multiple beams and *targetres=True* **,** all planes in the
   image will be convolved so that the resulting resolution is that
   specified by the kernel parameters. If the image has multiple
   beams and *targetres=False*, each plane will be convolved with a
   Gaussian specified by beam (and hence, in general, the output
   image will also have multiple beams that vary with spectral
   channel and/or polarization).
   
   If the units on the original image include Jy/beam, the units on
   the output image will be rescaled by the ratio of the input and
   output beams as well as rescaling by the area of convolution
   kernel in order to conserve flux density.
   
   If the units on the original image include K, then only the image
   convolution kernel rescaling is done.
   
   .. rubric:: Boxcar Kernel
   
   *major* is the length of the box along the y-axis, and *minor* is
   length of the box along the x-axis. *pa* is not used and beam
   should not be specified. The value of *targetres* is not used.
   
   .. rubric:: General
   
   The *major, minor,* and *pa* parameters can be specified in one of
   three ways:
   
   #. Quantity -- for example *major=qa.quantity(1, 'arcsec')*. Note
      that you can use pixel units, such as *major=qa.quantity(1,
      'pix')*.
   #. String -- for example *minor='1pix'* or *major='0.5arcsec*
      (i.e. a string that the Quanta quantity function accepts).
   #. Numeric -- for example *major=10*. In this case, the units of
      *major* and *minor* are assumed to be in arcsec and units of
      *pa* are assumed to be degrees.
   
   Note: Using pixel units allows you to convolve axes with different
   units.
   
   .. rubric:: Image Kernel
   
   If *kernel="i"* or *"image"*, the image specified by *kimage* is
   used to convolve the input image. The coordinate system of the
   convolution image is ignored; only the pixel values are
   considered.
   
   Fourier-based convolution is performed.
   
   The provided kernel can have fewer dimensions than the image being
   convolved. In this case, it will be padded with degenerate axes.
   An error will result if the kernel has more dimensions than the
   image.
   
   The scaling of the output image is determined by the *scale*
   parameter. If this is left unset, then the kernel is normalized to
   unit sum. If *scale* is not left unset, then the convolution
   kernel will be scaled (multiplied) by this value.
   
   Masked pixels will be assigned the value 0.0 before convolution.
   
   The output mask is the intersection (logical AND) of the default
   input image pixel mask (if any) and the OTF mask. Any other input
   pixel masks will not be copied. The function **ia.maskhandler()**
   should be used if there is a need to copy other masks too.
