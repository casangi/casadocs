Description
   imstat task: Displays statistical information from an image or image
   region
   
   Many parameters are determined from the specified region of an
   image. The region can be specified by a set of rectangular pixel
   coordinates, the channel ranges and the
   Stokes or a region file.
   
   .. warning:: **Alert:** When both the *region* parameter and any of
      *box*/*chans*/*stokes* are specified simultaneously, the task
      may perform unwanted selections, so this should be avoided. See
      this chapter on region files
      for more information.
   
   For directed output, run as:
   
   ::
   
      myoutput=imstat()
   
   General procedure:
   
   ::
   
      #Specify inputs, then
      myoutput=imstat()
      #or specify inputs directly in calling sequence to task
      myoutput=imstat(imagename='image.im', etc)
      myoutput['KEYS'] #will contain the result associated with any
      of the keys given below

   .. rubric:: CURSOR AXES
      
   
   The *axes* parameter allows one to set the cursor axes over
   which statistics are computed. For example, consider a
   3-dimensional image for which *axes=[0,2]*. The statistics would
   be computed for each XZ (axes 0 and 2) plane in the image. One
   could then examine those statistics as a function of the Y (axis
   1) axis.
   Each statistic is stored in an array in its own field in the
   returned dictionary. The dimensionality of these arrays is equal
   to the number of axes over which the statistics were not
   evaluated (called the display axes). For example, if the input
   image has four axes, and *axes=[0]*, the output statistic arrays
   will have three dimensions. If *axes=[0, 1]*, the output
   statistic arrays will have two dimensions.
   The shape of the output arrays when axes has a positive number
   of elements is based on the region selection. If there is no
   region selection, the shape of the statistic arrays is just the
   shape of the image along the display (non-cursor) axes. For
   example, if the input image has dimensions of 300x400x4x80 (RA x
   Dec x Stokes x Freq) and *axes=[0, 1]*, in the absence of a
   region selection, the shape of the output statistic arrays will
   be 4x80. If there is a region selection, the shape of the output
   statistic arrays will be determined by the number of planes
   along the display axes chosen in the region selection. For
   example, continuing with our example, if *axes=[0,1]*,
   *chans="5~15;30~70"*, and *stokes="IV"*, the output statistic
   arrays will have shapes of 2x52. Only the selected planes will
   be displayed in the logger output if *verbose=True*.
   In the case where the image has a pixel mask, and/or the *mask*
   parameter is specified, and because of this specification a
   plane is entirely masked, this element is included in the
   statistic arrays (usually with a value of 0). It is not included
   in the logger output if *verbose=True*. One can exclude such
   elements from computations on the output arrays by using the
   numpy.extract() method. For example, to compute the minimum rms
   value, not including any fully masked planes, one could use
   
   ::
   
      stats = imstat(...)
      rmsmin = numpy.min(numpy.extract(stats['npts']>0,
      stats['rms']))
   
   Thus in the computation of rmsmin, only the rms elements are
   considered which have associated values of 'npts' that are greater
   than zero.
   
    
   
   .. rubric:: ALGORITHMS
      
   
   Several types of statistical algorithms are supported:
   
   .. rubric:: CLASSIC
      
   
   This is the familiar algorithm, in which all unmasked pixels are
   used. One may choose one of two methods, which vary only by
   performance, for computing classic statistics via the *clmethod*
   parameter. The "tiled" method is the old method and is fastest in
   cases where there are a large number of individual sets of
   statistics to be computed and a small number of data points per
   set. This can occur when one sets the *axes* parameter, which
   causes several individual sets of statistics to be computed. The
   "framework" method uses the new statistics framework to compute
   statistics. This method is fastest in the regime where one has a
   small number of individual sets of statistics to calculate, and
   each set has a large number of points. For example, this method is
   fastest when computing statistics over an entire image in one go
   (no *axes* specified). A third option, "auto", chooses which
   method to use by predicting which be faster based on the number of
   pixels in the image and the choice of the *axes* parameter.
   
   .. rubric:: FIT-HALF
      
   
   This algorithm calculates statistics on a dataset created from
   real and virtual pixel values. The real values are determined by
   the input parameters *center* and *lside*. The parameter *center*
   tells the algorithm where the center value of the combined
   real+virtual dataset should be. Options are the mean or the median
   of the input image's pixel values, or at zero. The *lside*
   parameter tells the algorithm on which side of center the real
   pixel values are located. True indicates that the real pixel
   values to be used are ≤ center. False indicates the real pixel
   values to be used are ≥ center. The virtual part of the dataset is
   then created by reflecting all the real values through the center
   value, to create a perfectly symmetric dataset composed of a real
   and a virtual component. Statistics are then calculated on this
   resultant dataset. These two parameters are ignored if algorithm
   is not "FIT-HALF". Because the maximum value is virtual if *lside*
   is True and the minimum value is virtual if *lside* is False, the
   value of the maximum position (if *lside=True*) or minimum
   position (if *lside=False*) is not reported in the returned
   record.
   
   .. rubric:: HINGES-FENCES
      
   
   This algorithm calculates statistics by including data in a range
   between :math:`Q1 - f*D` and :math:`Q3 + f*D`, inclusive, where Q1
   is the first quartile of the distribution of unmasked data,
   subject to any specified pixel ranges, Q3 is the third quartile,
   :math:`D = Q3 - Q1` (the inner quartile range), and f is the
   user-specified fence factor. Negative values of f indicate that
   the full distribution is to be used (i.e., the classic algorithm
   is used). Sufficiently large values of f will also be equivalent
   to using the "CLASSIC" algorithm. For f = 0, only data in the
   inner quartile range is used for computing statistics. The value
   of fence is silently ignored if algorithm is not "HINGES-FENCES".
   
   .. rubric:: CHAUVENET
      
   
   The idea behind this algorithm is to eliminate outliers based on a
   maximum *z-score* parameter value. A *z-score* is the number of
   standard deviations a point is from the mean of a distribution.
   This method thus is meant to be used for (nearly) normal
   distributions. In general, this is an iterative process, with
   successive iterations discarding additional outliers as the
   remaining points become closer to forming a normal distribution.
   Iterating stops when no additional points lie beyond the specified
   *z-score* value, or, if *z-score* is negative, when Chauvenet's
   criterion is met (see below). The parameter *maxiter* can be set
   to a non-negative value to prematurely abort this iterative
   process. When *verbose=T*, the "N-iter" column in the table that
   is logged represents the number of iterations that were executed.
   
   Chauvenet's criterion allows the target *z-score* to decrease as
   the number of points in the distribution decreases on subsequent
   iterations. Essentially, the criterion is that the probability of
   having one point in a normal distribution at a maximum *z-score*
   of z :sub:`max` must be at least 0.5. z :sub:`max` is therefore
   a function of (only) the number of points in the distribution and
   is given by
   
   npts = 0.5/erfc(z :sub:`max`/:math:`\sqrt{2}`)
   
   where erfc() is the complementary error function. As iterating
   proceeds, the number of remaining points decreases as outliers are
   discarded, and so z :sub:`max` likewise decreases. Convergence
   occurs when all remaining points fall within a *z-score* of
   z :sub:`max`. Below is an illustrative table of z :sub:`max`
   values and their corresponding npts values. For example, it is
   likely that there will be a 5-sigma "noise bump" in a perfectly
   noisy image with one million independent elements.

   .. rubric:: BIWEIGHT
      
   
   The biweight is a robust method to determine the center and width
   of a distribution. It uses the median and median absolute
   deviation to effectively downweight points in the distribution
   that are more than 4 standard deviations from the center of the
   distribution and then computes center (i.e., "location") and the
   width (i.e., "scale") of the distribution. These quantities are
   analogous to the mean and the standard deviation for a standard
   normal distribution. Our implementation is based on the equations
   in Beers 1990  `[1] <#cit1>`__ and Iglewicz 1983 `[2] <#cit2>`__ .
   
   The data weights in this algorithm are
   
   .. math:: w_i = (1 - u_i^2)
   
   where :math:`u_i` is defined as

   .. math:: u_i = \frac{ x_i - c_{bi} } { c s_{bi} }
   
        
   
   The variable :math:`x_i` is the data values, :math:`c_{bi}` is
   the biweight location, :math:`s_{bi}` is the biweight scale, and
   :math:`c` is a constant. We adopt a value for :math:`c` of 6,
   which gives zero weight to observations more than 4 standard
   deviations from the median. For the initial computation of the
   :math:`u_i` values, :math:`c_{bi}` is set equal to the median of
   the distribution and :math:`s_{bi}` is set equal to the
   normalized MAD (median of the absolute deviation about the
   median), assuming a Gaussian distribution. This value is the MAD
   multiplied by 1.4826, i.e., the value of the probit function at
   0.75.

   The location, :math:`c_{bi}`, is then computed from
   
   .. math:: c_{bi} = \frac{ \sum_{w_i > 0} x_i  w_i^2 } { \sum_{w_i > 0} w_i^2  }   
   
   where only values of :math:`u_i` which satisfy :math:`|u_i| < 1`
   (:math:`w_i >0`) are included in the sums. Note that the weights
   are zero, not undefined, for points beyond 4 sigma.
   
   The scale value is computed using
   
   .. math:: s_{bi}^2 = \frac{ n \sum_{w_i > 0} (x_i - c_{bi})^2 w_i^4} {p \max(1,p-1)}
   
   where
   
   .. math:: p = | \sum_{w_i > 0} w_i (5w_i - 4) | 
   
   Again, the above sum includes only data for which
   :math:` | u_i |  < 1` (:math:`w_i >0`). The variable n is the
   number of points for the entire distribution, since points beyond
   4 standard deviations are downweights, not removed.
   
   The algorithm proceeds as follows.

   1. Compute initial :math:`u_i` values (and hence :math:`w_i`
      values) from the above equation, setting :math:`c_{bi}` equal to
      the median of the distribution and :math:`s_{bi}` equal to the
      normalized MAD.
   2. Compute the initial value of the scale using the
      :math:`w_i` values computed in step 1 using the equation for
      :math:`s_{bi}`.
   3. Recompute :math:`u_i` and :math:`w_i` values using the
      most recent previous scale and location values.
   4. Compute the location using the :math:`u_i` and
      :math:`w_i` values from step 3 and the equation for
      :math:`c_{bi}`.
   5. Recompute :math:`u_i` and :math:`w_i` values using the
      most recent previous scale and location values.
   6. Compute the new scale value using the the :math:`u_i` and
      :math:`w_i` values computed in step 5 and the value of the
      location computed in step 4.
   7. Steps 3 - 6 are repeated until convergence occurs or the
      maximum number of iterations (specified in the *niter*
      parameter) is reached. The convergence criterion is given by
   
           
   
   .. math:: | (s_{bi} - s_{bi,prev})/s_{bi,prev} | < 0.03  \sqrt{ \frac{0.5}{n - 1}}
   
   where :math:`s_{bi,prev}` is the value of the scale
   computed in the previous iteration.
   
   In the special case where *niter* is specified to be negative, the
   scale and location will be computed directly with no iteration.
   
   1. Compute :math:`u_i` and :math:`w_i` values using the
      median for the location and the normalized MAD as the scale.
   2. Compute the location and scale (which can be carried out
      simultaneously) using the :math:`u_i` and :math:`w_i` values
      computed in step 1. The value of the location used in the scale
      computation is just the median.
   
   The only keys present in the returned dictionary are 'mean'
   (location), 'sigma' (scale), 'npts', 'min', and 'max' to maximize
   speed. The last three represent the values using the entire
   distribution. Note that the biweight algorithm does not support
   computation of quantile-like values (median, medabsdevmed, q1, q3,
   and iqr), so setting *robust=True* will cause a warning message to
   be logged regarding that, and the computation will proceed. If you
   want to compute these quantities in addition those values
   calculated here, re-run **imstat** with selecting another
   algorithm.
   
    
   
   .. rubric:: NOTES ON FLUX DENSITIES AND FLUXES
      
   
   .. note:: Explanation of terminology:

      The terms "intensity" or "brightness" refer to quantities
      with a unit such as Jy/beam or Kelvin (K).

      The term "flux density" refers to quantities with a unit such
      as Janskys (Jy). This is dimensionally equivalent to
      W/m**2/Hz.

      The term "flux" refers to a flux density integrated over the
      spectral or velocity axis, such as Jy*km/s or Jy*Hz. These
      are dimensionally equivalent to W/m**2.
   
   Fluxes and flux densities are not computed if any of the following
   conditions is met:
   
   #. The image does not have a direction coordinate
   #. The image does not have a intensity-like brightness unit.
      Examples of such units are Jy/beam (in which case the image
      must also have a beam) and Kelvin (K)
   #. There are no direction axes in the cursor axes that are used
   #. If the (specified region of the) image has a non-degenerate
      spectral axis, and the image has a tabular spectral axis (axis

   #. Any axis that is not a direction nor a spectral axis that is
      included in the cursor axes is not degenerate within in
      specified region
   
   In cases where none of the above conditions is met, the flux
   density(ies) (intensities integrated over direction planes) will
   be computed if any of the following conditions is met:
   
   #. The image has no spectral coordinate
   #. The cursor axes do not include the spectral axis
   #. The spectral axis in the chosen region is degenerate
   
   In the case where there is a non-degenerate spectral axis that is
   included in the cursor axes, the flux (flux density integrated
   over spectral planes) will be computed. In this case, the spectral
   portion of the flux unit will be the velocity unit of the spectral
   coordinate if it has one (e.g., if the brightness unit is Jy/beam
   and the velocity unit is km/s, the flux will have units of Jy
   km/s). If not, the spectral portion of the flux unit will be the
   frequency unit of the spectral axis (e.g., if the brightness unit
   is K and the frequency unit is Hz, the resulting flux unit will be
   K arcsec :sup:`2` Hz).
   
   In both cases of flux density or flux being computed, the
   resulting numerical value is assigned to the "flux" key in the
   output dictionary.
   
   If the image has units of Jy/beam, the flux density is just the
   mean intensity multiplied by the number of beam areas included in
   the region. The beam area is defined as the volume of the
   elliptical Gaussian defined by the synthesized beam, divided by
   the maximum of that function, which is equivalent to
   
   :math:`\frac {π}{4 ln(2)} * FWHM_{major} * FWHM_{minor}`
   
   where ln() is the natural logarithm and :math:`FWHM_{major}` and
   :math:`FWHM_{minor}` are the major and minor full width at half
   maximum (FWHM) axes of the beam, respectively.
