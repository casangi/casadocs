Description

   .. warning:: There are `Known Issues <../../notebooks/introduction.html#Known-Issues>`__ for simanalyze.
   
   This task is for imaging and analyzing MeasurementSets (MSs)
   simulated with **simobserve** or **simalma**.
   
   **simanalyze** analyzes one or more MeasurementSets -
   interferometric and/or single dish, using CASA's
   `tclean <../../api/casatasks.rst>`__
   task. It can also calculate and display the difference between the
   simulated observation and the original model data, and generate a
   "fidelity image". Fidelity is defined as:
   
   .. math:: \begin{equation} \frac{I}{|I-T|} \end{equation}
   
   where I is the observed image intensity and T is the true image
   intensity, given in this case by the sky model (see `ALMA memo
   398 <http://library.nrao.edu/public/memos/alma/memo398.pdf>`__ for
   description of fidelity). The input parameters are therefore
   grouped by the two main pieces of functionality:
   
   #. Image - Image the visibility data with CASA's
      `tclean <../../api/casatasks.rst>`__
      task. Most of the parameters are passed to the wrapper method
      **simutil.imtclean**, which in turn calls **tclean**.

   #. Analyze - Calculate and display the difference between output
      and input, and the fidelity image. Different diagnostic images
      can be chosen to plot on a multi-panel figure, with the
      different show parameters. That figure can be saved as a .png
      file if *graphics='both'* or *graphics='file'*. 
   
   The output is a synthesized image, a difference image between the
   synthesized image and your sky model convolved with the output
   synthesized beam, and a fidelity image. 
   
   .. note:: **NOTE**: If you prefer to run **tclean** manually (e.g., to
      interactively clean with a mask), you can do that, and then use
      **simanalyze** to convolve the sky model and create difference
      and fidelity images by setting *image=False*.
   
   .. rubric:: Task output
   
   Below is a list of the products produced by the **simanalyze**
   task. Not all of these will necessarily be produced, depending on
   the input parameters selected.
   
   .. note:: **NOTE**: To support various runs using differing arrays, the
      file names have the configuration name from the antenna list
      appended.

         difference and fidelity

         convolved model and flattened output
      -  [project].[cfg].image.flat = 2D integrated intensity image,
         not corrected for primary beam; see

      -  [project].[cfg].simanalyze.last = saved input parameters for
         **simanalyze** task, available in CASAshell

   .. warning:: **WARNING**: The simalma/simanalyze tasks do not support
      wideband multi-term imaging. Please use tclean (with other image
      analysis tasks) if your simulated MS from simobserve requires
      wideband continuum image reconstruction.
   
   .. rubric:: Parameter descriptions
   
   *project*
   
   This parameter should be set to the same name as used when running
   **simobserve** or **simalma** for the directory of results
   generated. In particular, [project]/[project].skymodel will be
   required in order to compare output and input images.
   
   .. note:: **NOTE**: **simanalyze** was designed to be used after one or
      more runs of **simobserve**, and as such it assumes it will be
      able to find a sky model image called
      [project]/[project].skymodel, .newmodel, or .compskymodel in
      the [project]/ subdirectory. If the simulated MS has been
      created by means other than simply calling **simobserve**, the
      user may have to copy their sky model image into the project
      subdirectory and call it [project].skymodel.
   
   *image*
   
   This parameter determines if **simanalyze** produces images or
   not. Note that this task always uses *deconvolver='clark'* in
   **tclean**.
   
   .. warning:: **WARNING**: As is the case for real images, cleaning images
      produced by **simobserve** can lead to a spurious decrease in
      object fluxes and noise on the image (an effect known as "clean
      bias"). This is particularly true for observations with poor
      coverage of the uv-plane, i.e., using telescopes with small
      numbers of antennas, such as the ALMA Early Science
      configurations, and/or in short "snapshot" observations. Users
      should always clean images with care, using a small number of
      iterations and/or a conservative (3-5sigma) threshold and
      boxing bright sources.
   
   .. rubric:: *image=True* expandable parameters
   
   *vis*
   
   Single or list of input MeasurementSets, which can include a total
   power MS. **simanalyze** will grid any total power MS, **tclean**
   (invert and deconvolve) any interferometric MSes, and **feather**
   the results. Examples: single MS: *vis="[project].alma.out03.ms"*;
   multiple MSes: *vis="[project].alma.out03.ms,
   [project].aca.tp.ms"*.
   
   The user can use *project* and let the task automatically replace
   it with the project name, e.g.,
   *vis="[project].noisy.ms,project.noisy.sd.ms"*. However, note that
   if you created MeasurementSet(s) using **simobserve**, the MS
   names will include the configuration, e.g.,
   [project].alma_out20.noisy.ms. Setting *vis='default'* will find
   and attempt to image all MeasurementSets (interferometric and
   single dish) in the [project]/ directory.
   
   *modelimage*
   
   It is often preferable to use a low resolution (single dish or
   synthesis) image as a prior model during clean deconvolution of a
   higher resolution interferometric MS. That is accomplished by
   putting the low-resolution image in *modelimage* and the MS to be
   deconvolved in *vis*.
   
   .. note:: **NOTE**: This is not the original skymodel that was used in
      simobserve or simalma. It is recommended to leave this blank
      unless the user is familiar with using a prior in clean
      deconvolution.
   
   .. note:: **NOTE 2**: *modelimage* will not be used if the MS to be
      imaged is total power.
   
   *imsize*
   
   The output image size in pixels (x,y), or set to 0 to match model
   (default). Examples: *imsize=[500,500]* or *imsize=500* result in
   the same image size.
   
   *imdirection*
   
   Sets the output image direction. If left unset (default), the
   model center will be used. Examples: *imdirection='J2000
   10h00m00.0s -30d00m00.0s'*
   
   *cell*
   
   Sets the cell size of the image with units. If left unset
   (default), the model cell size will be used. Examples:
   *cell='10arcsec'*
   
   *interactive*
   
   Turns interactive cleaning off or on. The default setting for this
   parameter is *interactive=False* (no interactive cleaning). If
   True, make sure to set *niter>0*.
   
   *niter*
   
   The maximum number of iterations to perform. This value can be
   changed for interactive cleaning (*interactive=True*) in the
   viewer GUI. Examples: *niter=5000*
   
   *threshold*
   
   This parameter sets the upper threshold for cleaning (**clean**
   will stop if this level is reached). The default is 0.1 mJy.
   Examples: *threshold='0.5mJy'*
   
   *weighting*
   
   This parameter sets the weighting that is to be applied to the
   visibility data. Options: 'natural' (+2.0 robust, default),
   'uniform' (-2.0 robust), or 'briggs'. If 'briggs' weighting is
   selected, the default robust factor of **tclean** will be used
   (0.5) and changing this parameter value is not supported by
   **simanalyze**. If a robust weighting is needed that is not
   available, it is suggested to set *image* to False and to clean
   manually with **clean**/**tclean**.
   
   *mask*
   
   Specification of cleanbox(es), mask image(s), primary beam
   coverage level, and/or region(s) to be used for cleaning.
   **clean** tends to perform better and is less likely to diverge if
   the clean component placement is limited by a mask to where real
   emission is expected to be. Examples: pixel ranges
   *mask=[110,110,150,145];* filename of mask image
   *mask='myimage.mask'*; or a file with mask regions
   *mask='mymask.txt'*.
   
   *outertaper*
   
   *outertaper* sets an outer threshold on baselines in the uv-plane,
   usually to achieve a lower angular resolution and to recover more
   extended emission that may be resolved out. Examples:
   *outertaper=[ ]* no outer taper applied; *outertaper=[’5klambda’]*
   circular uv taper FWHM at 5 kilo-lambda;
   *outertaper=[’5klambda’,’3klambda’,’45.0deg’]* elliptical
   Gaussian; *outertaper=[’10arcsec’]* on-sky FWHM of 10 arcsecs;
   *outertaper=[’300.0’]* 300m in aperture plane
   
   *pbcor*
   
   The *pbcor* parameter determines whether or not **simanalyze**
   corrects the flux based on the primary beam. If *pbcor=True*, a
   .pbcor image will be produced with the primary beam correction
   applied. This is set to True by default.
   
   *stokes*
   
   The *stokes* parameter specifies the Stokes parameters for the
   resulting images. Note that forming Stokes Q and U images requires
   the presence of cross-hand polarizations (e.g. RL and LR for
   circularly polarized systems such as the VLA) in the data. Stokes
   V requires both parallel hands (RR and LL) for
   circularly-polarized systems or the cross-hands (XY and YX) for
   linearly polarized systems such as ALMA and ATCA. Examples:
   *stokes = ’I’* intensity only (default); *stokes = ’IQU’*
   intensity and linear polarization; *stokes = ’IV’* intensity and
   circular polarization; *stokes = ’IQUV’* all Stokes imaging;
   *stokes = ’RR’* right hand polarization only; *stokes = ’XXYY’*
   both linear polarizations
   
   *featherimage*
   
   Sometimes it is preferable to grid the single dish MS using the
   **sdimaging** task for more control. In that case, the user can
   input the resulting single dish imaging under *featherimage*, only
   put interferometric MSs in *vis*, and **simanalyze** will clean
   the interferometric and feather with the *featherimage*.

   
   .. rubric:: *image=False* expandable parameters
   
   *imagename*
   
   If the user already has a synthesized image they wish to use, it
   can be input using the parameter *imagename*.
   
   *skymodel*
   
   **simanalyze** will attempt to find an appropriate skymodel image
   - this is the \*.skymodel image created by **simobserve** or
   **simalma**, the (optionally rescaled) original sky model which
   was used to create the MeasurementSet. If a *skymodel* is not
   explicitedly assigned, **simanalyze** will look in the project
   directory.

   
   *analyze*
   
   This parameter is used to turn on or off the creation of
   analytical images pertaining to the simulation.
   
   .. rubric:: analyze=True expandable parameters
   
   When the *analyze* parameter is set to True, **simanalyze** will
   display the first 6 of the following analysis images, based on
   whether the sub-parameters are set to True or False. An image will
   also be created of the difference between the input skymodel and
   the simulated output image (whether that output image is being
   generated in the same call to **simanalyze**, with *image=True*,
   or has already been generated, and **simanalyze** is being called
   with *image=False*).
   
   *showuv*
   
   Displays a plot of the uv coverage for the simulation.
   
   *showpsf*
   
   Displays a synthesized (dirty) beam (ignored in single dish
   simulation).
   
   *showmodel*
   
   Displays the sky model at its original resolution.
   
   *showconvolved*
   
   Displays the sky model convolved with an output beam.
   
   *showclean*
   
   Displays the synthesized image.
   
   *showresidual*
   
   Displays the clean residual image (ignored in single dish
   simulation).
   
   *showdifference*
   
   Displays the difference between output cleaned image and input
   model sky image convolved with an output clean beam.
   
   *showfidelity*

   Displays the fidelity image. The fidelity image is defined by the
   following equation:
   
   :math:`fidelity = \frac{|input|}{max[|input-output|,0.7\*rms(output)]}`
   
   .. note:: **NOTE**: The RMS is calculated in the lower quarter of the
      image which is likely not the best choice. It is encouraged to
      measure RMS manually in an off-source region using the
      **viewer**.

   
   *graphics*
   
   Displays graphics based on the manner in which the parameter is
   set. Options: 'screen', 'file', 'both', 'none'
   
   *verbose*
   
   Turns on or off the reporting of task activity in the log.
   Examples: *verbose=False* (default)
   
   *overwrite*
   
   If the user would like **simanalyze** to replace the previously
   created files starting with the *project* name, set this parameter
   to True (default).
   
   *dryrun*
   
   *dryrun=True* is an advanced technical mode only useful for
   interferometric (not single dish) data.
   
   *logfile*
   
   Allows for a user-defined log file naming convention if
   *verbose=True*.
