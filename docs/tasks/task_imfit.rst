.. _Description:

Description
   This task is used to fit one or more two dimensional
   Gaussians to sources in an image as well as an optional zero-level
   offset. Fitting is limited to a single polarization but can be
   performed over several contiguous spectral channels. If the image
   has a clean beam, the report and returned dictionary will contain
   both the convolved and the deconvolved fit results. For examples
   and explanation of the dictionary, see the `Image Plane
   Analysis <../../notebooks/image_analysis.ipynb#Image-Plane-Analysis>`__
   pages.

   When dooff is False, the method returns a dictionary with keys
   named 'converged', 'pixelsperarcsec', 'results', and
   'deconvolved'. The value of 'converged' is a boolean array which
   indicates if the fit converged on a channel by channel basis. The
   value of 'pixelsperarcsec' is a two element double array with the
   absolute values of the direction coordinate pixel increments
   (longitude-like and latitude-like coordinate, respectively) in
   arcsec. The value of 'results' is a dictionary representing a
   component list reflecting the fit results. In the case of an image
   containing beam information, the sizes and position angles in the
   'results' dictionary are those of the source(s) convolved with the
   restoring beam, while the same parameters in the 'deconvolved'
   dictionary represent the source sizes deconvolved from the beam.
   In the case where the image does not contain a beam, 'deconvolved'
   will be absent. Both the 'results' and 'deconvolved' dictionaries
   can be read into a component list tool (default tool is named cl)
   using the fromrecord() method for easier inspection using tool
   methods, eg
   
   ::
   
      cl.fromrecord(res['results'])
   

   although this only works if the flux density units are conformant
   with Jy.
   
   There are also values in each component subdictionary not used by
   **cl.fromrecord()** but meant to supply additional information.
   There is a 'peak' subdictionary for each component that provides
   the peak intensity of the component. It is present for both
   'results' and 'deconvolved' components. There is also a 'sum'
   subdictionary for each component indicating the simple sum of
   pixel values in the the original image enclosed by the fitted
   ellipse. There is a 'channel' entry in the 'spectrum'
   subdictionary which provides the zero-based channel number in the
   input image for which the solution applies. In addtion, if the
   image has a beam(s), then there will be a 'beam' subdictionary
   associated with each component in both the 'results' and
   'deconvolved' dictionaries. This subdictionary will have three
   keys: '*beamarcsec*' will be a subdictionary giving the beam
   dimensions in arcsec, '*beampixels*' will have the value of the
   beam area expressed in pixels, and '*beamster*' will have the
   value of the beam area expressed in steradians. Also, if the image
   has a beam(s), in the component level dictionaries will be an
   'ispoint' entry with an associated boolean value describing if the
   component is consistent with a point source. Each component level
   dictionary will have a 'pixelcoords' entry which has the value of
   a two element numeric array which provides the direction pixel
   coordinates of the fitted position.
   
   If *dooff* is True, in addition to the specified number of
   Gaussians, a zero level offset will also be fit. The initial
   estimate for this offset is specified using the *offset*
   parameter. Units are assumed to be the same as the image
   brightness units. The zero level offset can be held constant
   during the fit by specifying *fixoffset=True*. In the case of
   *dooff=True*, the returned dictionary contains two additional
   keys, '*zerooff*' and '*zeroofferr*', which are both dictionaries
   containing '*unit*' and '*value*' keys. The values associated with
   the '*value*' keys are arrays containing the fitted zero level
   offset value and its error, respectively, for each channel. In
   cases where the fit did not converge, these values are set to NaN.
   The value associated with '*unit*' is just the image brightness
   unit.
   
   The region can either be specified by a *box(es)* or a *region*.
   Ranges of pixel values can be included or excluded from the fit.
   If specified using the *box* parameter, multiple boxes can be
   given using the format *box* ="blcx1, blcy1, trcx1, trcy1, blcx2,
   blcy2, trcx2, trcy2, ... , blcxN, blcyN, trcxN, trcyN" where N is
   the number of boxes. In this case, the union of the specified
   boxes will be used.
   
   The default behavior of imfit is to fit a single Gaussian
   component. If a multiple-Gaussian fit is desired, the user must
   specify initial estimates via a text file (see below for details).
   If no estimate file is specified, imfit will attempt to guess the
   initial parameters and fit a single Gaussian to the union of
   specified boxes/regions. Users who wish to perform individual fits
   to separate regions should run imfit multiple times, specifying a
   single input box/region each time.
   
   If specified, the *residual* and/or *model* images for successful
   fits will be written.
   
   The user has the option of writing the result of the fit to a log
   file, and has the option of either appending to or overwriting an
   existing file.
   
   The user has the option of writing the (convolved) parameters of a
   successful fit to a file which can be fed back to **imfit** as the
   new estimates file for a subsequent run.
   
   The user has the option of writing the fit results in tabular
   format to a file whose name is specified using the *summary*
   parameter.
   
   If specified and positive, the value of *rms* is used to calculate
   the parameter uncertainties, otherwise, the rms in the selected
   region in the relevant channel is used for these calculations.
   
   The *noisefwhm* parameter represents the noise-correlation beam
   FWHM. If specified as a quantity, it should have angular units. If
   specified as a numerical value, it is set equal to that number of
   pixels. If specified and greater than or equal to the pixel size,
   it is used to calculate parameter uncertainties using the
   correlated noise equations (see below). If it is specified but
   less than a pixel width, the uncorrelated noise equations (see
   below) are used to compute the parameter uncertainties. If it is
   not specified and the image has a restoring beam(s), the
   correlated noise equations are used to compute parameter
   uncertainties using the geometric mean of the relevant beam major
   and minor axes as the noise-correlation beam FWHM. If *noisefwhm*
   is not specified and the image does not have a restoring beam,
   then the uncorrelated noise equations are used to compute the
   parameter uncertainties.
   
   .. rubric:: SUPPORTED UNITS
   
   Currently only images with brightness units conformant with
   Jy/beam, Jy/beam km/s, and K are fully supported for fitting. If
   your image has some other base brightness unit, that unit will be
   assumed to be equivalent to Jy/pixel and results will be
   calculated accordingly. In particular, the flux density (reported
   as Integrated Flux in the logger and associated with the "flux"
   key in the returned component subdictionary(ies)) for such a case
   represents the sum of pixel values.
   
   Note also that converting the returned results subdictionary to a
   component list via **cl.fromrecord()** currently only works
   properly if the flux density units in the results dictionary are
   conformant with Jy. If you need to be able to run
   **cl.fromrecord()** on the resulting dictionary you can first
   modify the flux density units by hand to be (some prefix)Jy and
   then run cl.fromrecord() on that dictionary, bearing in mind your
   unit conversion.
   
   If the input image has units of K, the flux density of components
   will be reported in units of [prefix]K*rad*rad, where prefix is an
   SI prefix used so that the numerical value is between 1 and 1000.
   To convert to units of K*beam, determine the area of the
   appropriate beam, which is given by
   
   .. math:: \begin{equation} \frac{\pi}{4 \rm{ln} 2} \, b_{\rm maj} \,b_{\rm min} \end{equation}
   
   where :math: `b_{\rm maj}` and :math:`b_{\rm min}` are the major
   and minor axes of the beam, and convert to steradians (=rad*rad).
   This value is included in the beam portion of the component
   subdictionary (key '*beamster*'). Then divide the numerical value
   of the logged flux density by the beam area in steradians. So, for
   example
   
   ::
   
      # run on an image with K brightness units
      res = imfit(...)
      # get the I flux density in K*beam of component 0
      comp = res['results']['component0']
      flux_density_kbeam = comp['flux']['value'][0]/comp['beam']['beamster']
   
    
   
   .. rubric:: FITTING OVER MULTIPLE CHANNELS
   
   For fitting over multiple channels, the result of the previous
   successful fit is used as the estimate for the next channel. The
   number of Gaussians fit cannot be varied on a channel by channel
   basis. Thus the variation of source structure should be reasonably
   smooth in frequency to produce reliable fit results.
   
   .. rubric:: MASK SPECIFICATION
   
   `Mask <../../notebooks/image_analysis.ipynb#Image-Masks>`__
   specification can be done using an `LEL
   expression <../../notebooks/image_analysis.ipynb#Lattice-Expression-Language>`__.
   For example
   
   ::
   
      mask = "myimage>5"
   
   will use only pixels with values greater than 5.
   
   .. rubric:: INCLUDING AND EXCLUDING PIXELS
   
   Pixels can be included or excluded from the fit based on their
   values using these parameters. Note that specifying both is not
   permitted and will cause an error. If specified, both take an
   array of two numeric values.
   
   .. rubric:: ESTIMATES
   
   Initial estimates of fit parameters (peak intensity, peak x pixel
   coordinate, peak y pixel coordinate, major axis, minor axis,
   position angle) may be specified via an estimates text file. Each
   line of this file should contain a set of parameters for a single
   Gaussian. Optionally, some of these parameters can be fixed during
   the fit. The format of each line is: peak intensity, peak x-pixel
   value, peak y-pixel value, major axis, minor axis, position angle,
   fixed.
   
   The fixed parameter is optional. The peak intensity is assumed
   to be in the same units as the image pixel values (eg Jy/beam).
   The peak coordinates are specified in pixel coordinates. The
   major and minor axes and the position angle are the convolved
   parameters if the image has been convolved with a clean beam and
   are specified as quantities. The fixed parameter is optional and
   is a string. It may contain any combination of the following
   characters 'f' (peak intensity), 'x' (peak x position), 'y'
   (peak y position), 'a' (major axis), 'b' (axial ratio, R =
   (major axis FWHM)/(minor axis FWHM)), 'p' (position angle).

   **NOTE: One cannot hold the minor axis fixed without holding the
   major axis fixed.** If the major axis is not fixed, specifying
   'b' in the fixed string will hold the axial ratio fixed during
   the fit.
   
   In addition, lines in the file starting with a # are considered
   comments.
   
   An example of such a file is:
   
   ::
   
      # peak intensity must be in map units
      120, 150, 110, 23.5arcsec, 18.9arcsec, 120deg
      90, 60, 200, 46arcsec, 23arcsec, 140deg, fxp
   
   This is a file which specifies that two Gaussians are to be
   simultaneously fit, and for the second Gaussian the specified peak
   intensity, x position, and position angle are to be held fixed
   during the fit.
   
   .. rubric:: ERROR ESTIMATES
   
   Error estimates are based on the work of  Condon (1997)  [1]_
   
   Key assumptions made are:
   
   -  The given model (elliptical Gaussian, or elliptical Gaussian
      plus constant offset) is an adequate representation of the data
   -  An accurate estimate of the pixel noise is provided or can be
      derived (see above). For the case of correlated noise (e.g., a
      CLEAN map), the fit region should contain many "beams" or an
      independent value of rms should be provided.
   -  The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the Gaussian component is
      large. This is necessary because a Taylor series is used to
      linearize the problem. Condon (1997) states that the fractional
      bias in the fitted amplitude due to this assumption is of order
      1/S :sup:`2`, where S is the overall SNR of the Gaussian with
      respect to the given data set (defined more precisely below).
      For a 5 sigma "detection" of the Gaussian, this is a 4% effect.
   -  All (or practically all) of the flux in the component being fit
      falls within the selected region.
   
   If a constant offset term is simultaneously fit and not fixed, the
   region of interest should be even larger. The derivations of the
   expressions summarized in this note assume an effectively infinite
   region.
   
   Two sets of equations are used to calculate the parameter
   uncertainties, based on if the noise is correlated or
   uncorrelated. The rules governing which set of equations are used
   have been described above in the description of the *noisefwhm*
   parameter.
   
   In the case of uncorrelated noise, the equations used are
   
   .. math:: \begin{equation} \frac{\sigma(A)}{A} = \frac{\sigma(I)}{I} = \frac{\sigma(\theta_M)}{\theta_M} = \frac{\sigma(\theta_m)}{\theta_m} = \sqrt{8ln2} \frac{\sigma(x_0)}{\theta_M} = \sqrt{8ln2}\frac{\sigma(y_0)}{\theta_m} = \frac{\sigma(\phi)}{\sqrt{2}}(\frac{\theta_M^2-\theta_m^2}{\theta_M\theta_m}) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\rho}\end{equation}
   
   where :math:`\sigma(z)` is the uncertainty associated with
   parameter :math:`z`, :math:`A` is the peak intensity, :math:`I` is
   the flux density, :math:`\theta_M` and :math:`\theta_m` are the
   FWHM major and minor axes, :math:`\phi` is the position angle of
   the component, :math:`x_0` and :math:`y_0` are the direction
   uncertainties of the component measured along the major and minor
   axes; the resulting uncertainties measured along the principle
   axes of the image direction coordinate are calculated by
   propagation of errors using the 2D rotation matrix which enacts
   the rotation through the position angle plus 90 degrees.
   :math:`\rho` is the overall signal to noise ratio of the
   component, which, for the uncorrelated noise case, is given by
   
   .. math:: \begin{equation} \rho = \frac{A}{h\mu}\sqrt{\frac{\pi\theta_M\theta_m}{8ln2}} \end{equation}
   
   where :math:`h` is the pixel width of the direction coordinate and
   :math:`\mu` is the rms noise (see the discussion above for the
   rules governing how the value of :math:`\mu` is determined).
   
   For the correlated noise case, the same equations are used to
   determine the uncertainties as in the uncorrelated noise case,
   except for the uncertainty in :math:`I` (see below). However,
   :math:`\rho` is given by
   
   .. math:: \begin{equation} \rho = \frac{A}{\mu}\frac{\sqrt{\theta_M\theta_m}}{2\theta_N}\left(1 + \left(\frac{\theta_N}{\theta_M}\right)^2\right)^{\alpha_M/2}\left(1 + \left(\frac{\theta_N}{\theta_m}\right)^2\right)^{\alpha_m/2} \end{equation}
   
   where :math:`\theta_N` is the noise-correlation beam FWHM (see
   discussion of the *noisefwhm* parameter for rules governing how
   this value is determined). Variables :math:`\alpha_M` and
   :math:`\alpha_m` depend on which uncertainty is being calculated.
   For :math:`\sigma(A)`, :math:`\alpha_M` = :math:`\alpha_m` = 3/2.
   For :math:`\sigma_M` and :math:`x_0`, :math:`\alpha_M` = 5/2 and
   :math:`\alpha_m` = 1/2. For :math:`\theta_m`, :math:`y_0`, and
   :math:`\phi`, :math:`\alpha_M` = 1/2 and :math:`\alpha_m` = 5/2.
   :math:`\sigma(I)` is calculated in the correlated noise case
   according to
   
   .. math:: \begin{equation} \frac{\sigma(I)}{I} = \sqrt{ \left(\frac{\sigma(A)}{A}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\theta_N^2}{\theta_M\theta_m}\right)\left[\left(\frac{\sigma(\theta_M)}{\theta_M}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sigma(\theta_m)}{\theta_m}\right)^2 \right] } \end{equation}
   
   Note well the following caveats:
   
   -  Fixing Gaussian component parameters will tend to cause the
      parameter uncertainties reported for free parameters to be
      overestimated.
   -  Fitting a zero level offset that is not fixed will tend to
      cause the reported parameter uncertainties to be slightly
      underestimated.
   -  The parameter uncertainties will be inaccurate at low SNR (a
      ~10% for SNR = 3).
   -  If the fitted region is not considerably larger than the
      largest component that is fit, parameter uncertainties may be
      mis-estimated.
   -  An accurate rms noise measurement, :math:`\mu`, for the region
      in question must be supplied. Alternatively, a sufficiently
      large signal-free region must be present in the selected region
      (at least about 25 noise beams in area) to auto-derive such an
      estimate.
   -  If the image noise is not statistically independent from pixel
      to pixel, a reasonably accurate noise correlation scale,
      :math:`\theta` :math:`_N`, must be provided. If the noise
      correlation function is not approximately Gaussian, the
      correlation length can be estimated using
   
   .. math:: \begin{equation} \theta_N = \sqrt{ \frac{2 \ln (2)}{\pi} } \, \frac{  \iint C(x,y) \mathrm{d}x \mathrm{d}y} { \sqrt{ \iint C(x,y)^2 \mathrm{d}x \mathrm{d}y}   } \end{equation}
   
   where C(x,y) is the associated noise-smoothing function.
   
   -  If fitted model components have significant spatial overlap,
      the parameter uncertainties are likely to be mis-estimated
      (i.e., correlations between the parameters of separate
      components are not accounted for).
   -  If the image being analyzed is an interferometric image with
      poor uv sampling, the parameter uncertainties may be
      significantly underestimated.
   
   The deconvolved size and position angle errors are computed by
   taking the maximum of the absolute values of the differences of
   the best fit deconvolved value of the given parameter and the
   deconvolved size of the eight possible combinations of (FWHM major
   axis +/- major axis error), (FWHM minor axis +/- minor axis
   error), and (position angle +/- position angle error). If the
   source cannot be deconvolved from the beam (if the best fit
   convolved source size cannot be deconvolved from the beam), upper
   limits on the deconvolved source size are reported, if possible.
   These limits simply come from the maximum major and minor axes of
   the deconvolved Gaussians taken from trying all eight of the
   aforementioned combinations. In the case none of these
   combinations produces a deconvolved size, no upper limit is
   reported.
