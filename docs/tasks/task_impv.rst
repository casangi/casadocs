Description
   Create a position-velocity image. The way the slice is specified
   is controlled by the *mode* parameter. When *mode="coords"*, start
   and end are used to specify the points between which slice is
   taken in the direction coordinate. If *mode="length",* *center, pa
   (position angle),* and *length* are used to specify the slice.
   Note that impv will treat any string starting with "c" as
   *"coords"* and any string starting with "l" as *"length".* The
   spectral extent of the resulting image will be that provided by
   the *region* specification or the entire spectral range of the
   input image if no *region* is specified. One may not specify a
   *region* in direction space; that is accomplished by specifying
   the slice as described previously.
   
   The parameters *start* and *end* may be specified as two element
   arrays of numerical values, in which case these values will be
   interpreted as pixel locations in the input image. Alternatively,
   they may be expressed as arrays of two strings each representing
   the direction. These strings can either represent quantities (e.g.
   ["40.5deg", "0.5rad") or be sexigesimal format (e.g.
   ["14h20m20.5s","-30d45m25.4s"], ["14:20:20.5s","-30.45.25.4"]). In
   addition, they may be expressed as a single string containing the
   longitude-like and latitude-like values and optionally a reference
   frame value, e.g. "J2000 14:20:20.5s -30.45.25.4".The *center*
   parameter can be specified in the same way. The *length* parameter
   may be specified as a single numerical value, in which case it is
   interpreted as the length in pixels, or a valid quantity, in which
   case it must have units conformant with the direction axes units.
   The *pa* (position angle) parameter must be specified as a valid
   quantity with angular units. The position angle is interpreted in
   the usual astronomical sense; e.g. measured from north through
   east in an equatorial coordinate system. The slice in this case
   starts at the specified position angle and ends on the opposite
   side of the specified center. Thus *pa="45deg"* means start at a
   point at a *pa* of 45 degrees relative to the specified center and
   end at a point at a *pa* of 225 degrees relative to the center.
   Either *start/end* or *center/pa/length* must be specified; if a
   parameter from one of these sets is specified, a parameter from
   the other set may not be specified. In either case, the *end*
   points of the segment must fall within the input image, and they
   both must be at least 2 pixels from the edge of the input image to
   facilite rotation (see below).
   
   One may specify a *width*, which represents the number of pixels
   centered along and perpendicular to the direction slice that are
   used for averaging along the slice. The *width* may be specified
   as an integer, in which case it must be positive and odd.
   Alternatively, it may be specified as a valid quantity string
   (e.g., "4arcsec") or quantity record (e.g.
   qa.quantity("4arcsec")). In this case, units must be conformant
   to the direction axes units (usually angular units) and the
   specified quantity will be rounded up, if necessary, to the next
   highest equivalent odd integer number of pixels. The default
   value of 1 represents no averaging. A value of 3 means average
   one pixel on each side of the slice and the pixel on the slice.
   Note that this *width* is applied to pixels in the image after
   it has been rotated (see below for a description of how rotation
   is applied).

   One may specify the *unit* for the angular offset axis.
   Internally, the image is first rotated, padding if necessary to
   include relevant pixels that would otherwise be excluded by the
   rotation operation, so that the slice is horizontal, with the
   starting pixel left of the ending pixel. Then, the pixels within
   the specified width of the slice are averaged and the resulting
   image is written and/or returned. The output image has a linear
   coordinate in place of the direction coordinate of the input
   image, and the corresponding axis represents angular offset with
   the center pixel having a value of 0.

   The equivalent coordinate system, with a (usually) rotated
   direction coordinate (e.g., RA and Dec) is written to the output
   image as a table record. It can be retrieved using the table
   tool (see the examples tab, which is linked from the top of this
   page).
   
   Note that because the ouput image does not have a direction
   coordinate, other image analysis tasks and tool methods may not be
   able to process it correctly if it is used as an input image. In
   such cases when possible, the task or tool method in question
   should be first run on the input image that would have been used
   in impv, and then impv should be run using as the input image, the
   output image from the task or tool method in question. That is,
   the output image of impv should normally be considered to be the
   end point of any image analysis sequence for tasks/tool methods.

      # create a pv image with the position axis running from ra,
      # dec pixel positions of [45, 50] to [100, 120] in the input image
      impv(imagename="my_spectral_cube.im", outfile="mypv.im", start=[45,50], end=[100,120])

      # analyze the pv image, such as get statistics
      pvstats = imstat("mypv.im")

      # get the alternate coordinate system information
      tb.open("mypv.im")
