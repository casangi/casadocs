Description
   This is the new implementation of **hanningsmooth**.
   
   .. note:: Task **hanningsmooth2** has been renamed to **hanningsmooth**.
      Please, update your scripts to call **hanningsmooth** instead.
   
   The new **hanningsmooth** task uses the MSTransform framework
   underneath but keeps roughly the same interface as previous
   version of hanningsmooth.
   
   This function Hanning smooths the frequency channels with a
   weighted running average. The weights are 0.5 for the central
   channel and 0.25 for each of the two adjacent channels. The first
   and last channels are flagged. Inclusion of a flagged value in an
   average causes that data value to be flagged.
   
   If the *CORRECTED* data column is requested for an MS that does
   not contain this column, it will use *DATA* to calculate the
   smoothing and save it to *DATA* in the output MS.
   
   .. warning:: WARNING: by default, all visibility columns will be smoothed.
   
   .. rubric:: Parameter Descriptions

   .. rubric:: Input and output MeasurementSets
   
   The input visibility file (MS or MMS) given by the
   *vis* parameters will be Hanning smoothed and saved in an output
   given by the *outputvis* parameter.
   
   For example, *vis* = ['ngc5921.ms'] *, output vis* =
   'out_ngc5921.mms'. 
   
   .. rubric:: Output MS or Multi-MS: keepmms parameter
   
   If *keepmms* = True, a
   `Multi-MS <../../notebooks/parallel-processing.ipynb#The-Multi-MS>`__
   will be created as the output if the input is a Multi-MS(MMS),
   which is the default behaviour. The output Multi-MS will have the
   same partition axis of the input MMS. See the `Parallel
   Processing <../../notebooks/parallel-processing.ipynb>`__
   chapter for more information on the MMS format.
   
   .. rubric:: Data Column parameter
   
   The parameter *datacolumn* chooses which column to use for the
   processing (case-insensitive). The default is set to all columns
   that exist in the input MS. 
   
   .. rubric:: Data Selection parameters
   
   For more details on how to perform data selection within the MS
   (i.e., selecting by field, SPW, antenna, etc.), see the
   `Visibility Data
   Selection <../../notebooks/visibility_data_selection.ipynb>`__
   chapter.
   

.. _Examples:

Examples
   Apply Hanning smoothing on the CORRECTED column. The output will
   be saved into the DATA column.
   
   ::
   
      hanningsmooth(vis='example.ms', outputvis='test.ms',
                    datacolumn='corrected')
   
   Apply Hanning smoothing on all visibility columns of the Multi-MS.
   In this case, if CASA is started with
   `mpicasa <../../notebooks/parallel-processing.ipynb#Configuration-and-Control>`__,
   the processing will happen in parallel.
   
   ::
   
      hanningsmooth(vis='example.mms', outputvis='test.mms') --> default
   
      hanningsmooth(vis='example.mms', outputvis='test.mms',
                    datacolumn='all', keepmms=True) --> set the parameters explicitly
   

.. _Development:

Development
   The following information was in the inline help for hanningsmooth
   but is now being maintained in one place in the Visibility Data
   Selection chapter, so a link has been added to those pages. It has
   been deleted from the Description tab for now and included below
   for reference in case it's needed, once a comprehensive plan has
   been established for all task pages with this issue. 

   
       --- Data selection parameters ---

       field -- Select field using field id(s) or field name(s).
                [run listobs to obtain the list iof d's or names]
           default: ''=all fields If field string is a non-negative
              integer, it is assumed to be a field index
              otherwise, it is assumed to be a field name
              field='0~2'; field ids 0,1,2
              field='0,4,5~7'; field ids 0,4,5,6,7
              field='3C286,3C295'; fields named 3C286 and 3C295
              field = '3,4C*'; field id 3, all names starting with 4C
       spw -- Select spectral window/channels
           default: ''=all spectral windows and channels
              spw='0~2,4'; spectral windows 0,1,2,4 (all channels)
              spw='&lt;2';  spectral windows less than 2 (i.e. 0,1)
              spw='0:5~61'; spw 0, channels 5 to 61
              spw='0,10,3:3~45'; spw 0,10 all channels, spw 3 - chans 3 to 45.
              spw='0~2:2~6'; spw 0,1,2 with channels 2 through 6 in each.
              spw = '*:3~64'  channels 3 through 64 for all sp id's
                      spw = ' :3~64' will NOT work.
                  NOTE: mstransform does not support multiple channel ranges per
                        spectral window (';').
       scan -- Scan number range
           default: ''=all
       antenna -- Select data based on antenna/baseline
           default: '' (all)
               Non-negative integers are assumed to be antenna indices, and
               anything else is taken as an antenna name.
           examples:
               antenna='5&amp;6': baseline between antenna index 5 and index 6.
               antenna='VA05&amp;VA06': baseline between VLA antenna 5 and 6.
               antenna='5&amp;6;7&amp;8': baselines 5-6 and 7-8
               antenna='5': all baselines with antenna 5
               antenna='5,6,10': all baselines including antennas 5, 6, or 10
               antenna='5,6,10&amp;': all baselines with \*only\* antennas 5, 6, or
                                      10.  (cross-correlations only.  Use &amp;&amp;
                                      to include autocorrelations, and &amp;&amp;&amp;
                                      to get only autocorrelations.)
               antenna='!ea03,ea12,ea17': all baselines except those that
                                          include EVLA antennas ea03, ea12, or
                                          ea17.
       correlation -- Correlation types or expression.
           default: '' (all correlations)
           example: correlation='XX,YY'
       timerange -- Select data based on time range:
           default: '' (all); examples,
              timerange = 'YYYY/MM/DD/hh:mm:ss~YYYY/MM/DD/hh:mm:ss'
              Note: if YYYY/MM/DD is missing date, timerange defaults to the
              first day in the dataset
              timerange='09:14:0~09:54:0' picks 40 min on first day
              timerange='25:00:00~27:30:00' picks 1 hr to 3 hr 30min
              on next day
              timerange='09:44:00' data within one integration of time
              timerange='&gt;10:24:00' data after this time
       array -- (Sub)array number range
           default: ''=all
       uvrange -- Select data within uvrange (default units meters)
           default: ''=all; example:
               uvrange='0~1000klambda'; uvrange from 0-1000 kilo-lambda
               uvrange='&gt;4klambda';uvranges greater than 4 kilo-lambda
               uvrange='0~1000km'; uvrange in kilometers
       observation -- Select by observation ID(s)
           default: ''=all
       feed -- Selection based on the feed - NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
           default: ''=all

       datacolumn -- Which data column to use for processing (case-insensitive).
           default: 'all'; whichever of the visibility data columns that are present.
           options: 'data', 'model', 'corrected', 'all','float_data', 'lag_data'.

           example1: datacolumn='data'; it will smooth the input DATA column and save the
                     smoothed data in DATA of the output MS.
           example2: datacolumn='corrected'; it will smooth the input CORRECTED_DATA column
                     and save the smoothed data in DATA of the output MS.
           example3: datacolumn='all', where the input MS has DATA,CORRECTED_DATA,MODEL_DATA.
                     It will smooth all three columns and save the smoothed data in
                     DATA, CORRECTED_DATA and MODEL_DATA of the output MS.
