Description
   .. warning:: **WARNING** *:* The task **oldstatwt** is identical to the
      task statwt in previous CASA versions, given that the current
      statwt underwent significant development for CASA 5.4.
   
   The WEIGHT and SIGMA columns of measurement sets are often set to
   arbitrary values (e.g., 1), or theoretically estimated from poorly
   known antenna and receiver properties. Many tasks (e.g.,
   **clean**) are insensitive to an overall scale error in WEIGHT,
   but are affected by errors in the relative weights between
   visibilities. Other tasks, such as **uvmodelfit**, or any task
   which depends on theoretical estimates of the noise, require
   (reasonably) correct weights and sigmas. **oldstatwt** empirically
   measures the visibility scatter (typically as a function of time,
   antenna, and/or baseline) and uses that to set WEIGHT and SIGMA.
   It is important that all necessary calibrations are applied to the
   data prior to running this task for correct determination of
   weights and sigmas.
   
   .. note:: **NOTE**: Some of the parameters (*byantenna*, *sepacs*,
      *fitcorr*, and *timebin*) are not yet fully implemented.

   
   .. rubric:: Parameter descriptions
   
   *vis*
   
   Name of input visibility file. Default: none. Examples:
   *vis='ngc5921.ms'*
   
   *dorms*
   
   Estimate the scatter using RMS instead of the standard deviation.
   
   Ideally the visibilities used to estimate the scatter, as selected
   by *fitspw* and *fitcorr*, should be pure noise. If you know for
   certain that they are, then setting dorms to True will give the
   best result. Otherwise, use False (standard sample standard
   deviation). More robust scatter estimates like the interquartile
   range or median absolute deviation from the median are not offered
   because they require sorting by value, which is not possible for
   complex numbers. Default: False.
   
   *byantenna*
   
   Assume that the noise is factorable by antenna (feed). If False,
   treat it separately for each baseline (recommended if there is
   strong signal). Default: False (**\* *byantenna=True* is not yet
   implemented)
   
   .. rubric:: *byantenna=True* expandable parameters
   
   *sepacs*
   
   If solving by antenna, treat autocorrelations separately.
   (Acknowledge that what autocorrelations "see" is very different
   from what crosscorrelations see.) Default: True (not yet
   implemented).
   
   *fitspw*
   
   The (ideally) signal-free spectral window:channels to estimate the
   scatter from. Default: '' (All).
   
   *fitcorr*
   
   The (ideally) signal-free correlations to estimate the scatter
   from. Default: '' (All) (not yet implemented)
   
   *combine*
   
   Let samples span multiple spws, corrs, scans, and/or states.
   Examples:
   
   -  *combine = 'spw'*: Recommended when a line spans an entire spw
      - set *fitspw* to the neighboring spws and apply their weight
      to the line spw(s). However, the effect of the line signal per
      visibility may be relatively harmless compared to the noise
      difference between spws.
   -  *combine = 'scan'*: Can be useful when the scan number goes up
      with each integration, as in many WSRT MSes.
   -  *combine = ['scan', 'spw']*: disregard scan and spw numbers
      when gathering samples.
   -  *combine = 'spw,scan'*: Same as above.
   
   Default: '' (None).
   
   *timebin*
   
   Sample interval. Default: '0s' or '-1s' (1 integration at a time).
   Examples: *timebin='30s'*, '10' means '10s' (not yet
   implemented)
   
   *minsamp*
   
   Minimum number of unflagged visibilities for estimating the
   scatter. Selected visibilities for which the weight cannot be
   estimated will be flagged. Note that *minsamp* is effectively at
   least 2 if *dorms* is False, and 1 if it is True.
   
   *field*
   
   Select fields in mosaic. Use field id(s) or field name(s). [go
   listobs to obtain the list id's or names] Default: '' = all
   fields. If field string is a non-negative integer, it is assumed
   to be a field index otherwise, it is assumed to be a field name.
   Examples: *field='0~2'*, field ids 0,1,2; *field='0,4,5~7'*, field
   ids 0,4,5,6,7; *field='3C286,3C295'*, field named 3C286 and 3C295;
   *field = '3,4C\*'*, field id 3 and all names starting with 4C.
   
   *spw*
   
   Select spectral window/channels. Default: '' => all spectral
   windows and channels. Examples: *spw='0~2,4'*, spectral windows
   0,1,2,4 (all channels); *spw='0:5~61'*, spw 0, channels 5 to 61;
   *spw='<2'*, spectral windows less than 2 (i.e. 0,1);
   *spw='0,10,3:3~45'*, spw 0,10 all channels, spw 3, channels 3 to
   45; *spw='0~2:2~6'*; spw 0,1,2 with channels 2 through 6 in each;
   *spw='0:0~10;15~60'*; spectral window 0 with channels 0-10,15-60;
   *spw='0:0~10,1:20~30,2:1;2;3'*; spw 0, channels 0-10, spw 1,
   channels 20-30, and spw 2, channels, 1,2 and 3.
   
   *antenna*
   
   Select data based on antenna/baseline. Default: '' (all). If
   antenna string is a non-negative integer, it is assumed to be an
   antenna index, otherwise, it is considered an antenna name.
   Examples: *antenna='5&6'*; baseline between antenna index 5 and
   index 6; *antenna='VA05&VA06'*, baseline between VLA antenna 5 and
   6; *antenna='5&6;7&8'*, baselines 5-6 and 7-8; *antenna='5'*, all
   baselines with antenna index 5; *antenna='05'*, all baselines with
   antenna number 05 (VLA old name); *antenna='5,6,9'*, all baselines
   with antennas 5,6,9 index numbers.
   
   *timerange*
   
   Select data based on time range. Default: '' (all). Examples:
   *timerange = 'YYYY/MM/DD/hh:mm:ss~YYYY/MM/DD/hh:mm:ss'*;
   
   .. note:: **NOTE**: if YYYY/MM/DD is missing date defaults to first day
      in data set.
   
   *timerange='09:14:0~09:54:0'* picks 40 min on first day;
   *timerange='25:00:00~27:30:00'* picks 1 hr to 3 hr 30min on NEXT
   day; *timerange='09:44:00'* pick data within one integration of
   time; *timerange='>10:24:00'* data after this time.
   
   *scan*
   
   Scan number range. Default: '' (all). Examples: *scan='1~5'*.
   Check 'go listobs' to insure the scan numbers are in order.
   
   *intent*
   
   Select by scan intent (state). Case sensitive. Default: '' = all.
   Examples: *intent = 'CALIBRATE_ATMOSPHERE_REFERENCE'*; *intent =
   'calibrate_atmosphere_reference'*.upper() same as above. Select
   states that include one or both of CALIBRATE_WVR.REFERENCE or
   OBSERVE_TARGET_ON_SOURCE; *intent = 'CALIBRATE_WVR.REFERENCE,
   OBSERVE_TARGET_ON_SOURCE'*
   
   *array*
   
   (Sub)array number range. Default: ''=all.
   
   *correlation*
   
   Select correlations, e.g. 'RR, LL' or ['XY', 'YX']. Default ''
   (all).
   
   .. note:: **NOTE**: In CASA v4.5, non-trivial correlation selection has
      been disabled since it was not working correctly, and it is
      likely undesirable to set the weights in a
      correlation-dependent way.

   
   *observation*
   
   Select by observation ID(s). Default: '' = all.
   
   *datacolumn*
   
   Which data column to calculate the scatter from. Default:
   *datacolumn='corrected'*. Examples: *datacolumn='data'*. Options:
   'data', 'corrected', 'model', 'float_data'
   
   .. note:: **NOTE**: 'corrected' will fall back to DATA if CORRECTED_DATA
      is absent.
