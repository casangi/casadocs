Description
   This task grids/images total power and spectral data according
   to a specified gridding kernel. The input data should be
   calibrated and bandpass corrected (where necessary), and the
   output is a CASA image format dataset, either 2-d, 3-d, or 4-d
   depending on the input parameters.

   The output image contains up to four axes: two spatial axes,
   frequency, and polarization. By default, the spatial coordinates
   are determined such that the imaged area is covered with a cell
   size equal to 1/3 of the FWHM of the primary beam of antennas in
   the first MS. It is also possible to define the spatial axes of
   the image by specifying the image center direction
   (*phasecenter*), the number of image pixels (*imsize*), and the
   pixel size (*cell*).

   The frequency coordinate of the image is defined by three
   parameters: the number of channels (*nchan*), the channel
   number/frequency/velocity of the first channel (*start*), and
   the channel width (*width*).  The *start* and *width* parameters
   can be in units of 'channel' (use channel number), 'frequency'
   (e.g., 'GHz'), or 'velocity' (e.g., 'km/s'). By default,
   *nchan*, *start*, and *width* are set so that all selected
   spectral windows are covered with a channel width equal to the
   separation of the first two channels selected.
   Finally, the polarization axis of the image is determined by the
   *stokes* parameter. For example, *stokes* ='XXYY' produces an
   image cube with each plane containing the image of one of the
   polarizations, while stokes='I' produces a "total intensity", or
   Stokes I image.

   The parameter *gridfunction* sets the gridding function
   (convolution kernel) for imaging. Currently, the task supports
   'BOX' (boxcar), 'SF' (Prolate Spheroidal Wave Function), 'GAUSS'
   (Gaussian), 'GJINC' (Gaussian*Jinc), where Jinc(x) =
   :math:`J_1(π*x/c)/(π*x/c)` with a first order Bessel function J_1,
   and 'PB' (Primary Beam).

   There are four subparameters for *gridfunction*: *convsupport,
   truncate, gwidth*, and *jwidth*. The *convsupport* parameter is
   an integer specifying the cutoff radius for 'SF' in units of
   pixels. By default (*convsupport* =-1), the cutoff radius is 3
   pixels. The *truncate* parameter is a cutoff radius for 'GAUSS'
   or 'GJINC'. It accepts integer, float, and string values, where
   the string would be a number plus unit. Allowed units include
   'deg', 'arcmin', 'arcsec', and 'pixel'. The default is 'pixel'.
   The default value for *truncate*, which is used when a negative
   radius is set, is 3*HWHM for 'GAUSS', and the radius at the
   first null for 'GJINC'. The *gwidth* is the HWHM of the Gaussian
   for 'GAUSS' and 'GJINC'. The default value is sqrt(log(2))
   pixels for 'GAUSS' and 2.52*sqrt(log(2)) pixels for 'GJINC'. The
   *jwidth* specifies the width of the jinc function (parameter 'c'
   in the definition above). The default is 1.55 pixels. Both
   *gwidth* and *jwidth* allow integer, float, or string values,
   where the string would be a number plus unit.  The default
   values for *gwidth* and *jwidth* are taken from Mangum, et al.
   2007 `[1] <#cit1>`__ . The formula for 'GAUSS' and 'GJINC' are
   taken from Table 1 in the paper, and are written as follows
   using *gwidth* and *jwidth*:

   GAUSS: :math:`\exp[-\log(2)*(|r|/gwidth)^2]`

   GJINC: :math:`J_1(π*|r|/jwidth)/(π*|r|/jwidth)* \exp[-\log(2)*(|r|/gwidth)^2]`

   The *imagename* should be unique. Clean will stop with an
   Exception error (e.g. Exception: Unable to open lattice) if
   *imagename* is the same as the *vis* name.

   The *ephemsrcname* parameter can be set to specifiy an ephemeris
   for a moving source (solar sytem objects).  If the source name
   in the data matches one of the solar system objects known by
   CASA, the imaging realigns the data by shifting the source, so
   that the source appears to be fixed in the image.
   The *clipminmax* function can clip minimum and maximum value
   from each pixel. This function makes the computed output
   slightly more robust to noise and spurious data.  Note the
   benefit of clipping is lost when the number of integrations
   contributing to each gridded pixel is small, or where the
   incidence of spurious data points is approximately equal to or
   greater than the number of beams (in area) encompassed by the
   expected image.

   The *minweight* parameter defines a threshold of weight values to
   mask. The pixels in *outfile* whose weight is smaller than
   *minweight* \*median (*weight*) are masked out. The task also
   creates a weight image with the name outfile.weight.

   The *projection* parameter allows to specify what kind of map
   projection is applied. The default is SIN (slant orthographic)
   projection. Besides that, the task supports CAR (plate carrée),
   TAN (gnomonic), and SFL (Sanson-Flamsteed).

Examples
   To generate a spectral line cube with 500 channels selected from
   channel 200 to 700:

   ::

      spw='0'
      pol='XX'
      src='Moon'

      sdimaging(infiles='mydata.ms',
                spw=spw,
                nchan=500,
                start='200',
                width='1',
                cell=['30.0arcsec','30.0arcsec'],
                outfile='mydata.ms.im',
                imsize=[80,80],
                gridfunction='GAUSS',
                gwidth='4arcsec',
                stokes=pol,
                ephemsrcname=src)

   The *start* parameter can be specified in different units:

   ::

      start=100  # mode='channel'
      start='22.3GHz'  # mode='frequency'
      start='5.0km/s'  # mode='velocity'



   The parameter *ephemsrcname* can be set to a solar system object:

   ::

      ephemsrcname ='MERCURY'

Development
   Here would be a discussion of how applycal is implemented.  This
   is intended for the other members of the development team so is a
   technical discussion.  We will work on building these up over
   time.
