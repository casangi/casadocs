Description

   .. warning:: There are `Known Issues <../../notebooks/introduction.html#Known-Issues>`__ for simobserve.
   
   This task simulates interferometric or total power
   MeasurementSets. The general steps for simulation in CASA are
   described on the top
   `Simulation <../../notebooks/simulation.ipynb>`__
   page. We describe the first two steps in more detail here.
   
   #. Make a model image or componentlist representation of the sky
      brightness distribution.
   #. Use the **simobserve** task to create a MeasurementSet (uv
      data).
   
   .. rubric:: Generating a Model Image
   
   A "model image" is a CASA image or FITS file that contains a
   representation of the sky brightness distribution, and it
   represents the object to be "observed" in the simulation. There
   are several ways to generate a model image.
   
   .. rubric:: Starting from an existing FITS image
   
   The simplest option is to begin with an existing FITS image. The
   image can be either a single plane (i.e., one observed frequency
   channel) or a cube. A common simulation exercise is to begin with
   a FITS file representing an observation of a target, then scale
   the spatial axes and the flux to shift the data to what would be
   observed for a similar target at a different distance. The
   **simobserve** task has parameters to set the peak flux density,
   coordinates on the sky, pixel size, frequency of the center
   channel, and channel width.
   
   .. rubric:: Starting from a component list
   
   .. warning:: **WARNING**: **simobserve** does not currently handle component
      lists correctly for single-dish-only simulations. It is advised
      to convert the component list to an image or FITS file.
   
   It may be useful to simulate observations of an idealized model
   image consisting, for example, of point sources and Gaussians. The
   CASA component list tool (**cl**) allows the user to specify a set
   of point sources, Gaussians, and disks. One
   can then either use that component list directly
   in **simobserve**, or create a CASA image from the components, or
   both. Details can be found in the Simulations `CASA
   guide <http://casaguides.nrao.edu>`__ entitled 'Simulation Guide Component Lists'.
   
   .. rubric:: Starting from a GIF or JPG image
   
   A user may wish to convert a GIF or JPG image to a FITS file for
   simulation in CASA. The image should be converted to a 32-bit FITS
   image for use with the CASA sim tools. Alternatively, you could use ImageMagik from the command
   line, like so:
   
   ::
   
      convert myfile.jpg myfile.fits
   
   Then proceed to trim and convert the file in CASA like so:
   
   ::
   
      importfits(fitsimage='myfile.fits',imagename='testimage',overwrite=T)

      default 'immath'
      imagename = 'testimage'
      expr = 'IM0'
      box = '0,0,299,299'
      outfile = 'testimage2'
      immath()
   
   You can use **imhead** to modify the header parameters of the new
   image, or you can use the parameters in the **simobserve** task to
   modify the peak flux density, coordinates on the sky, pixel size,
   frequency of the center channel, and channel width. See the
   discussion below.

   
   .. rubric:: Generating visibilities with simobserve
   
   The task **simobserve** takes several steps to generate observed
   visibilities. The major steps are:
   
   -  Modify Model: If desired, you can modify the header parameters
      in your data model to mimic different observing targets. For
      example, if you start with a model of M100 you might wish to
      scale the axes to simulate an observation of an M100-like
      galaxy that is 4X more distant.
   -  Set Pointings: If the angular size of your model image is
      comparable or larger than the 12-m primary beam, you can
      simulate observing the target as a mosaic. In this step, the
      individual pointings are determined and saved in a text file.
      You can also generate such a text file yourself.
   -  Generate visibilities: The visibilities are determined based on
      the telescope and configuration specified, and the length in
      time of the observation.
   -  Finally, noise can be added to the visibilities. The
      **simobserve** task uses the
      `aatm <http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/%7Ebn204/alma/atmomodel.html>`__
      atmospheric model (based on Juan Pardo's
      `ATM <http://cab.inta-csic.es/users/jrpardo/class_atm.html>`__
      library) to simulate real observing conditions. It can corrupt
      the data with thermal noise and atmospheric attenuation.
      Corruption with an atmospheric phase screen, or adding gain
      fluctuations or drift, can be added subsequently using the
      **simulator** tool **sm** as described in the Simulations `CASA
      Guide <https://casaguides.nrao.edu>`__ entitled 'Corrupting Simulated Data (Simulator Tool)'.
   
   For details, please see the descriptions of the individual
   parameters below.
   
   .. warning:: **WARNING**: It is currently not possible to generate a MS in a
      frame other than J2000 e.g., if you set *indirection* to "ICRS
      19h00m00 -40d00m00" it will silently assume that to actually be
      "J2000 19h00m00 -40d00m00". The reference frame can be set to
      ICRS during the imaging or **simanalyze** process.
   
   .. warning:: **WARNING**: when using a simulated MS in **tclean**, it should
      be considered best practice to declare the *phasecenter*
      parameter using the 'J2000 xx:xx:xx.xxx +xxx.xx.xx.xxx'
      notation to account for possible rounding errors that can
      create an offset in the simulated image.
   
   .. note:: **NOTE**: **simobserve** calls **sm.predict** with
      **sm.setvp** (*dovp=True*). This means that the vpmanager will
      be queried, and a primary beam pattern will be applied,
      according to the telescope name. One can set the primary beam
      for the given telescope using the **vpmanager**. In most
      circumstances, **simobserve** will use synthesis gridding
      (image-plane primary beam application), unless 1) there are
      more than 1 pointing, AND 2) there are more than one antenna
      diameter in the configuration file. In that case it will
      **sm.setoptions** (*ftmachine="mosaic"*) which enables
      heterogenous array simulation for ALMA, ACA, and OVRO
      telescopes.
   
      Treatment of the primary beam depends critically on parameters
      set in sm.setvp() and sm.setoptions(ftmachine) - see help
      sm.setvp for details. For componentlists, if sm.setvp() is run
      prior to predict, then the spectral variation of each component
      in the componentlist will include the multiplicative term of
      the beam value for each channel frequency. So a flat spectrum
      component will show the frequency variation of the beam in the
      predicted visibilities.
   
   .. rubric:: Task output

   Below is a list of the products produced by the **simobserve**
   task. Not all of these will necessarily be produced, depending on
   input parameters selected.

      names have the configuration name from antenna list appended.

   .. rubric:: Parameter descriptions

   *project*
   
   The root filename for all output files. This parameter should be
   set to the same name as used when running **simanalyze** or
   **simalma** for the directory of results generated.
   
   *skymodel*
   
   The input image (used as a model of the sky). **simobserve** uses
   a CASA or FITS image. If you merely have a grid of numbers, you
   will need to write them out as FITS or write a CASA script to read
   them in and use the **ia** tool to create an image and insert the
   data. **simobserve** does NOT require a coordinate system in the
   header. If the coordinate information is incomplete, missing, or
   you would like to override it, set the appropriate "in"
   parameters.
   
   .. note:: **NOTE**: Setting those parameters simply changes the header
      values, ignoring any values already in the image. No regridding
      is performed.
   
   You can also manipulate an image header manually with the
   **imhead** task. If you have a proper Coordinate System,
   **simobserve** will do its best to generate visibilities from
   that.
   
   .. rubric:: *skymodel* expandable parameters

   *inbright*
   
   Scales the model flux densities by setting the peak brightness of
   the britest pixel in Jy/pixel, or '' for unchanged.
   
   .. warning:: **WARNING**: 'unchanged' will take the numerical values in your
      image and assume they are in Jy/pixel, even if it says some
      other unit in the header.
   
   *indirection*
   
   The central direction to place the sky model image, or '' to use
   whatever is in the image already.
   
   *incell*
   
   The spatial pixel size to scale the skymodel image, or '' to use
   whatever is in the image already.
   
   *incenter*
   
   The frequency to use for the center channel (or only channel, if
   the skymodel is 2D). Examples: *incenter='89GHz'*, or '' to use
   what is in the header. This will also become the default rest frequency, e.g. when imaging with tclean.
   
   *inwidth*
   
   The width of the channels to use, or '' to use what is in the
   image should be a string representing a quantity with units.
   Examples: *inwidth='10MHz'*
   
   .. note:: **NOTE**: *inwidth* only works reliably with frequencies, not
      velocities.
   
   .. note:: **NOTE** **2**: It is not possible to change the number of
      spectral planes of the sky model, only to relabel them with
      different frequencies. That kind of regridding can be
      accomplished with the CASA toolkit.

   
   *complist*
   
   A component list model of the sky, added to or instead of
   *skymodel*.
   
   .. warning:: **WARNING**: **simobserve** does not currently handle component
      lists correctly for single-dish-only simulations. It is advised
      to convert the component list to an image or FITS file.
   
   .. rubric:: complist expandable parameters
   
   *compwidth*
   
   The bandwidth of components; if simulating from components only,
   this defines the bandwidth of the MS and output images.
   
   *comp_nchan*
   
   The number of channels in the output MS. Validated only for a
   positive integer number of channels, this parameter assumes a flat
   spectrum and equal spacing when setting the channel width in the
   output MS. Since variation in channel width as a function of
   frequency is not currently supported, it is not advised to use
   this parameter to simulate observations with spectral index or
   large fractional bandwidth (use a skymodel image instead).

   
   *setpointings*
   
   If True, **simobserve** calculates a map of pointings based on a
   set of sub-parameters and generates a pointing file. If False, it
   will read the pointings from the parameter *ptgfile*.
   
   .. rubric:: *setpointings=True* expandable parameters
   
   *integration*
   
   Sets the time interval for each integration. Also used with
   *setpointings=False*. Examples: *integration='10s'*
   
   .. note:: **NOTE**: To simulate a 'scan' longer than one integration, use
      *setpointings* to generate a pointing file, and then edit the
      file to increase the time at each point to be larger than the
      parameter integration time.
   
   *direction*
   
   The mosaic center direction. If left unset, **simobserve** will
   use the center of the skymodel image. Examples: *direction= 'J2000
   19h00m00 -40d00m00';* can optionally be a list of pointings,
   otherwise **simobserve** will cover a region of size *mapsize*
   according to *maptype*.
   
   *mapsize*
   
   The angular size of mosaic map to simulate. Set to '' to cover the
   model image.
   
   *maptype*
   
   How to calculate the pointings for the mosaic observation.
   'hexagonal', 'square' (rectangular raster), 'ALMA' for the same
   hex algorithm as the ALMA Cycle 1 OT or 'ALMA2012' for the
   algorithm used in the Cycle 0 OT.
   
   *pointingspacing*
   
   Spacing in between primary beams. "0.25PB" to use 1/4 of the
   primary beam FWHM, "nyquist" will use :math:`\lambda/d/2`, '' will
   use :math:`\lambda/d/\sqrt(3)` for INT, :math:`\lambda/d/3` for
   SD.
   
   .. rubric:: *setpointings=False* expandable parameters
   
   *ptgfile*
   
   A text file specifying directions in the following format, with
   optional integration times, e.g.,
   
   ::
   
      #Epoch     RA          DEC      TIME(optional)
      J2000 23h59m28.10 -019d52m12.35 10.0
   
   If the time column is not present in the file, it will use
   'integration' for all pointings.
   
   .. note:: **NOTE**: At this time the file should contain only science
      pointings: **simobserve** will observe these, then optionally
      the calibrator, then the list of science pointings again, etc,
      until totaltime is used up.

   
   *obsmode*
   
   Sets the observation mode to calculate visibilities from a
   skymodel image (which may have been modified above), an optional
   component list, and a pointing file (which also may have been
   generated above). This parameter takes two possible values:
   
   -  interferometer (or int)
   -  singledish (or sd)
   
   If simulating from a component list, you should specify
   *compwidth*, the desired bandwidth. There is not currently a way
   to specify the spectrum of a component, so simulations from a
   componentlist only will be continuum (1 chan).
   
   .. rubric:: *obsmode* expandable parameters ('int' or 'sd')
   
   *refdate*
   
   The date of simulated observation. Examples:
   *refdate='2014/05/21'*
   
   *hourangle*
   
   The hour angle of observation, given as a string of various
   possible formats. E.g., "-3:00:00", or "5h". The default setting
   for this parameter is *hourangle='transit'*, which is equivalent
   to 0h.
   
   *totaltime*
   
   The total time of an observation. Examples: *totaltime='7200s'* or
   if a number without units, interpreted as the number of times to
   repeat the mosaic.
   
   .. rubric:: *obsmode='int' expandable parameters*
   
   *antennalist*
   
   ASCII file containing antenna positions. Each row has x, y, and z
   coordinates and antenna diameter and name; header lines are
   required to specify the observatory name and coordinate system. If
   the configuration file does not include antenna names, the station
   name will be used instead.

   Standard array configuration files are found in your CASA data
   repository, os.getenv("CASAPATH").split()[0]+"/data/alma/simmos/".
   A string of the form "alma;0.5arcsec" will be parsed into a full
   12m ALMA configuration. If *antennalist=' '*, **simobserve** will
   not produce an interferometric MS. If simulating total power
   observations, be sure to accurately set the parameter
   *sdantlist*. 
   
   *caldirection*
   
   An unresolved calibrator can be observed interleaved with the
   science pointings. The calibrator is implemented as a point source
   clean component with this specified direction and
   flux= *calflux*.
   
   *calflux*
   
   Sets the flux density for the calibrator. Default is set to
   *calflux='1Jy'*.
   
   .. rubric:: *obsmode='sd' expandable parameters*
   
   *sdantlist*
   
   Single-dish antenna position file. If simulating total power
   observations, be sure to accurately set the
   parameter *sdantlist*. If this parameter is left unset,
   **simobserve** assumes the default configuration file for a single
   dish simulation (even if the configuration file is explicitly
   specified in *antennalist*). Default: *sdantlist='aca.tp.cfg'.*
   
   *sdant*
   
   The index of the antenna in the list to use for total power.
   Defaults to the first antenna on the list (*sdant=0*).
   Heterogeneous total power "arrays" are not currently supported.
   
   *thermalnoise*
   
   Adds thermal noise to the synthesized data. This parameter takes
   two possible values (not including unset ' '):
   
   -  tsys-atm: J. Pardo's ATM library will be used to construct an
      atmospheric profile for the ALMA site: altitude 5000m, ground
      pressure 650mbar, relhum=20%, a water layer of *user_pwv* at
      altitude of 2km, the sky brightness temperature returned by
      ATM, and internally tabulated receiver temperatures
   -  tsys-manual: instead of using the ATM model, specify the zenith
      sky brightness and opacity manually. Noise is added and then
      the visibility flux scale is referenced above the atmosphere. 
   
   In either mode, noise is calculated using the following
   assumptions:
   
   -  an antenna spillover efficiency of 0.96,
   -  taper of 0.86,
   -  surface accuracy of 25 and 300 microns for ALMA and EVLA,
      respectively, using the Ruze formula for surface efficiency,
   -  correlator efficiencies of 0.95 and 0.91 for ALMA and EVLA, and
   -  receiver temperatures:
   
      -  for ALMA: 25, 30, 40, 42, 50, 50, 72, 135, 105, 230 K
         interpolated between 35, 75, 110, 145, 185, 230, 345, 409,
         675, 867 GHz
      -  for EVLA: 500, 70, 60, 55, 100, 130, 350 K interpolated
         between 0.33, 1.47, 4.89, 8.44, 22.5, 33.5, 43.3 GHz
      -  for SMA: 67, 116, 134, 500 K interpolated between 212, 310,
         383, 660 GHz
   
   These are only approximate numbers and do not take into account
   performance at edges of receiver bands, nor are they guaranteed to
   reflect the most recent measurements. Caveat emptor. Use the
   **sm** tool to add noise if you want more precise control, and use
   the ALMA exposure time calculator for sensitivity numbers in
   proposals.
