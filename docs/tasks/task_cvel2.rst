Description
   .. warning:: ALERT: **cvel2** is currently an experimental task and will
      replace the current **cvel** in the near future. We will then
      remove current **cvel** and rename **cvel2** to **cvel**.
   
   The intent of **cvel2** is to transform channel labels and the
   visibilities to a spectral reference frame which is appropriate
   for the science analysis, e.g. from TOPO to LSRK to correct for
   Doppler shifts throughout the time of the observation. **cvel2**
   is based on **mstransform**.
   
   VLA and ALMA datasets are observed in TOPOcentric velocity frames
   with fixed sky frequencies that are calculated from the
   observatory velocity at the start of the observation, and kept
   throughout (Doppler setting). The data will need to be regridded
   to a constant velocity grid to avoid a smearing of spectral
   features (e.g. to the LSRK or BARYcentric velocity frames).
   **cvel2** can perform this operation. Naturally, the
   transformation of channel labels and visibilities into a different
   reference frame will change the shape of the spectral feature to
   some extent. According to the Nyquist theorem you should
   oversample a spectrum with twice the numbers of channels to retain
   the shape. We advise that for spectral regridding to a standard
   velocity system like LSRK or BARY the expected spectral features
   are oversampled at least by a factor of 3-4 of the linewidth to
   preserve the spectral shape and to minimize regridding artifacts. 
   
   **cvel2** is in fact a more general tasks that
   transforms visibilities between spectral frames for
   visibilities. Doppler correction is also applied during imaging
   with **tclean,** which is recommended for most cases. **cvel2** is
   still useful if the MS itself needs to be stored in a specific
   frame, e.g. for self-calibration on fixed velocity channels. An MS
   that was regridded using **cvel2** can be imaged in *channel* mode
   in **tclean** (although **tclean** will perform some internal
   regridding anyways). 
   
   .. rubric:: Gridding modes and parameters

   **cvel2** offers four gridding *mode* s: '*channel'*,
   '*velocity'*, '*frequency'*, and '*channel_b'*. All of the modes
   have the same four subparameters *nchan*, *start*, *width*, and
   *interpolation*.  *nchan* is the number of channels for all modes.
   The meaning and units of the parameters *start* and *width* depend
   on the gridding mode used:
   
   -  For the modes '*channel'* and '*channel_b'*, *start* is the
      input starting channel, and *width* the number of input
      channels to be merged into a single output channel.
   -  In *velocity* and *frequency* mode, *start* defines the first
      channel of the output grid and *width* the width of each
      channel in the output in velocity or frequency units,
      respectively.
   
   Negative *width* numbers run the channel sequence in the opposite
   direction.
   
   The difference between '*channel*' and '*channel_b*' is that
   '*channel*' forces the output to be on an equidistant grid based
   on first selected channel, whereas '*channel_b*' does not (which
   improves the speed of **cvel2**). Mode '*velocity*' also requires
   the specification of a rest frequency (*restfreq* parameter,
   and definition type ('*radio*' or '*optical*') in the
   *veltype* parameter.

   *interpolation* specifies the interpolation method between the
   spectral channels. The interpolation method '*fftshift'*
   calculates the transformed visibilities by applying a FFT, then a
   phase ramp, and then an inverse FFT. It will also perform
   pre-averaging, if necessary for the output grid (this will also
   increase the S/N). Note that if you want to use this interpolation
   method, your frequency grid needs to be equidistant, i.e. it only
   works in mode velocity with *veltype='radio'*, in mode
   '*frequency'*, and in mode '*channel'* (in the latter only if the
   input grid is itself equidistant in frequency). Note also that, as
   opposed to all other interpolation methods, this method will apply
   a constant (frequency independent) shift in frequency which is not
   fully correct in the case of large fractional bandwidth of the
   given spectral window
   
   The *phasecenter* parameter can be used to specify the field id or
   position that is used for the transformations. This can be useful
   for larger mosaics.
   
   Hanning smoothing is optionally offered in **cvel2**, but tests
   have shown that already the regridding process itself, if it
   involved a transformation from TOPO to a non-terrestrial reference
   frame, implies some smoothing (due to channel interpolation) such
   that Hanning smoothing may not be necessary.
   
   If **cvel2** has already established the grid that is desired for
   the imaging, tclean should be run with exactly the same frequency/velocity parameters
   as used in **cvel2** in order to avoid additional regridding in
   clean.
   
   .. rubric:: Multi-MS support

   The option *keepmms* is set by default. This implies that unless
   the value of *keepmms* is explicitly changed to False, **cvel2**
   will create a Multi-MS when the input is a Multi-MS. The output
   Multi-MS will keep the same partition axis of the input MMS. See
   the task *partition*
   for more information on the Multi-MS (MMS) format. **NOTE**: It is
   not possible to combine the spws if the input MMS was partitioned
   with separationaxis='spw'. In this case, the task will abort with
   an error.
   
   .. rubric:: cvel and cvel2

   **cvel2** replicates the functionality of **cvel**, although the
   following differences should be noted:
   
   -  The regridding calculations of **cvel2** have been modified in
      order to better align it with the regridding calculations of
      tclean. Also, **cvel2** will not perform a pre-average step
      automatically when the width of the output channels is more
      than twice the widtch of the input channels.
   -  **cvel2** also supports Multi-MS input, in which case it will
      create an output Multi-MS too.
   -  The parameter *passall* is not supported in **cvel2**. The user
      may achieve the same results of passall=True by splitting out
      the data that will not be regridded with **cvel2** and
      concatenate regridded and non-regridded sets at the end. In the
      case of Multi-MS input, the user should use virtualconcat to
      achieve a concatenated MMS.
   -  **cvel2** is based on and implemented in terms of the very
      general *mstransform* framework

.. _Examples:

Examples
   **Example 1:**
   
   Regrid a MeasurementSet 'myMS.ms'  to a new 'myMSregridded.ms',
   using velocity mode and a LSRK radio velocity definition.  The
   output width is given in velocity units. The output data has a
   structure of 10 channels, starting at 123 km/s with a width of
   0.1km/s. We use the HI rest frequency of 1.420405 GHz. 
   
   ::
   
      cvel2(vis='myMS.ms', outputvis='myMSregriddedVelMode.ms',
            outframe='LSRK', mode='velocity', veltype='radio',
            restfreq='1.420405GHz', nchan=10, start='123km/s',
            width='0.1km/s')
   
   **Example 2:**
   
   Regrid the same MS, but this time using channel mode. We start at
   channel 5, and create 10 new output channels, grouping 7 channels
   in the new bins. The output width is given in units of number of
   input channels. We also run the output MeasurementSet in reverse
   spectral order (note the negative value of width). This time we
   request a BARYcentric frame and use the interpolation method
   'fftshift'.
   
   ::
   
      cvel2(vis='myMS.ms', outputvis='myMSregriddedChannelMode.ms',
            outframe='BARY',  mode='channel', nchan=10, start=5, width=-7,
            interpolation='fftshift')
