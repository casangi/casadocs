   task description

   | Task **importnro** enables one to convert the data obtained with
     the NRO45m telescope into the CASA MS2 format. Usage of this
     task is very simple. Set *infile* and *outputvis*, then run the
     task. At this moment, only the OTF data (NOSTAR data) obtained
     with the SAM45 spectrometer is supported, and the OTF data
     obtained with the other spectrometers (e.g., AOS) and the PSW
     data (NEWSTAR data) are outside of scope (Jan./25/2017)
   | An important point in using **importnro** is the treatment of
     the beams of the multi-beam receiver such as FOREST, where
     different beams are assigned to different antennas (not
     beam!). When using other tasks such as **plotms** or
     **sdbaseline**, individual beams can be specified in the
     following ways:

   | (When you specify beam 1,)
   | antenna = ‘0&&&’,
   | antenna = ‘0&&0’, or
   | antenna = ‘NRO-BEAM0’.
   | Another important point is about the array of SAM45. Except for
     FOREST, **importnro** assigns SAM45’s sixteen arrays labelled
     A01-A16 to spw of 0-15 in ascending order, even if some
     different arrays share the same frequency setting. As a
     result, every MS2 file generated via **importnro** has sixteen
     spw IDs due to the high flexibility of the frequency setting in
     SAM45.

   | On the other hand, in the data obtained using FOREST,
     assignments of four beams, two polarizations, and two sidebands
     (4 x 2 x 2 = 16) to SAM45’s sixteen arrays are fixed, and there
     is no flexibility for users in choosing arrays when preparing
     the observation tables. Hence **importnro** generates a MS2 file
     which contains only two spw IDs (0 and 1) when importing FOREST
     OTF data. This is also the case in the so-called spectral window
     mode of FOREST, which enables one to use thirty-two arrays and
     to set four frequency settings. In this case **importnro**
     returns a MS2 file having four spw IDs (0-3).
   | The other parameters can be specified in the same manner as in
     the ALMA data. The results of the data import can be checked
     using task **listobs**.

Examples
   To import NRO45m OTF data:

   ::

      # The NRO45m OTF data obtained using the SAM45 spectrometer
      # has an extention of "Y".
      infile = 'OriKLA.OriKL.20170101235959.32.Y'
      outputvis = 'OriKLA.OriKL.20170101235959.32.Y.ms'
      importnro(infile=infile, outputvis=outputvis, overwrite=True, parallel=False)
