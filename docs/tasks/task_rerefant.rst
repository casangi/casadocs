Description
   The time-dependent phases for a specified caltable are
   re-referenced to a new antenna by the specified algorithm.
   
   .. rubric:: Introduction

   Fundamentally, the baseline visibility phases measured by a
   synthesis instrument are exclusively differences (between
   antennas), and so no absolute phase reference exists.
   Antenna-based calibration solutions thus have phases which are
   constrained only to satisfy the observed visibility phases;
   further, each solution in time is formally independent of all
   others, though stability (or at least continuity) in time is
   expected. Therefore, to assert phase continuity in time, it is
   conventional practice to assign a reference antenna whose phase
   will be held constant at zero in time. Any actual phase variation
   associated with the reference antenna will be transferred to the
   phase solutions of all others (consistent with satisfying the
   visibility phase differences), and if the time sampling is
   adequate, phase continuity for all antennas—and thus also for all
   visibility baselines—will be assured. Usually, the phase reference
   antenna is applied on the back-end of the calibration solving
   task, e.g., **gaincal** or **bandpass**.
   
   However, it is sometimes the case that the referencing must be
   reapplied with a different reference antenna choice, or with a
   different algorithm, e.g., due to dropouts (from visibility
   flagging) or other problems in the nominally preferred reference
   antenna. The **rerefant** task provides a convenient mechanism to
   achieve this without having to re-run the calibration solving task
   with only a new *refant* setting.
   
   .. rubric:: Input/Output parameters
   
   An input MS, input caltable, and output caltable are specified in
   *vis*, *tablein*, and *caltable*, respectively.
   
   .. rubric:: Reference antenna choice: *refant*
   
   Reference antennas are specified using the *refant* parameter. A
   list of antennas may be specified in decreasing order of
   preference. (See below for the conditions under which alternate
   reference antennas are used.)

   .. rubric:: Phase referencing mode: *refantmode*
   
   The *refantmode* parameter controls how the refant is applied.
   Currently available choices are 'flex' and 'strict'.
   
   .. rubric:: *refantmode='flex'*
   
   If the preferred or current *refant* drops out, switch to another.
   Alternate reference antennas will be chosen from the *refant*
   parameter (if a nontrivial list of antennas is specified), or
   according to proximity to the last-used refant. If and when the
   preferred refant returns, the referencing will switch back to it.
   Note that the preferred reference antenna may no longer be at zero
   at phase with respect to the alternate refant, and so it will
   return at a new phase value that will be kept constant from that
   point. Generally, this mode of referencing should ensure
   continuity at the available phase SNR (signal-to-noise ratio).
   However, under low SNR conditions, the effective cross-hand phase
   may not be assured stable at refant changes, since each hand of
   polarization is referenced independently, and the non-zero noise
   on the cross-hand phase difference will change. When doing
   polarimetry (which depends on stable cross-hand phase), it may be
   preferable to use *refantmode='strict'* (see below).
   
   .. rubric:: *refantmode='strict'*
   
   If the preferred or current refant is absent for a solution, flag
   all antennas at that solution. This mode ensures that the
   effective cross-hand phase will be maintained constant and equal
   to that of the chosen refant, and not subject to variation due to
   finite SNR when switching among reference antennas. If a list of
   antennas is specified in *refant*, only the first is used. Note
   that *refantmode='strict'* is not reversible, since the reason for
   flagging solutions is not preserved. Also note that a poor refant
   choice could lead to excessive data flagging when using this mode.

Examples
   To apply a prioritized list of reference antennas using
   *refantmode='flex'*:
   
   ::
   
      rerefant(vis='n5921.ms',
               tablein='n5921.gcal',
               caltable='n5921_ea03ish.gcal',  # Output caltable
               refant='ea03,ea05,ea23,ea01',   # prioritized list of reference antennas
               refantmode='flex')              # flexible use of alternates
   
   To strictly apply a preferred reference antenna:
   
   ::
   
      rerefant(vis='n5921.ms',
               tablein='n5921.gcal',
               caltable='n5921_ea03.gcal',     # Output caltable
               refant='ea03',                  # the strictly preferred reference antenna
               refantmode='strict')            # strict!
