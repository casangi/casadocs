Description
   You can use the **importfits** task to import a FITS image into
   CASA image format. Note, the CASA viewer can read FITS images so
   you donâ€™t need to do this if you just want to look at the image.
   
   The CASA FITS reader uses wcslib by Mark Calabretta and thus
   implements the latest FITS standard (3.0). The intention of both
   wcslib and the added CASA code is to accommodate certain common
   deviations from the standard and be forgiving rather than
   pedantic. In some cases, however, images deviating too far from
   the standard will not be readable and you might see error
   messages. Read these carefully and try to consult the FITS
   documentation
   ( https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/standard30/fits_standard30aa.pdf ) to
   see how you have to change the header of your FITS image to make
   it sufficiently compliant with the standard.
   
   The inputs for **importfits** are:
   
   ::
   
      # importfits :: Convert an image FITS file into a CASA image
      fitsimage         = ''    # Name of input image FITS file
      imagename         = ''    # Name of output CASA image
      whichrep          = 0     # If fits image has multiple coordinate reps, choose one.
      whichhdu          = -1    # If its file contains multiple images, choose one
                                # (0 = first HDU, -1 = first valid image).
      zeroblanks        = True  # Set blanked pixels to zero (not NaN)
      overwrite         = False # Overwrite pre-existing imagename
      defaultaxes       = False # Add the default 4D coordinate axes where they are missing;
                                # value True requires setting defaultaxesvalues
      defaultaxesvalues = []    # List of values to assign to added degenerate axes when
                                # defaultaxes==True (ra,dec,freq,stokes)
      beam              = []    # List of values to be used to define the synthesized beam
                                # [BMAJ,BMIN,BPA] (as in the FITS keywords)
   
   Here a description of the non-self-explanatory parameters:

   *whichrep* -- If the FITS image has multiple coordinate
   representations, this parameter lets you choose which one to use
   (numbering starts at 0). Example: whichrep=1 .
   
   *whichhdu* -- If the fits file contains multiple images, you can
   choose the header data unit by number. The value "-1" (default)
   chooses the first valid one.

   CASA images by default have a 4D coordinate system (ra, dec,
   stokes, freq). Your input image may not have that. Setting the
   parameter *defaultaxes* to True, will make **importfits** add
   the missing axes as degenerate (one-pixel) axes and will take
   the coordinate values for these axes from the list in the
   parameter *defaultaxesvalues* (ra,dec,stokes, freq). For
   existing axes, empty strings can be given as values. For the
   directions and spectral values, any valid angle/frequency
   expressions can be given. Example:
   defaultaxesvalues=['19h30m00', '-02d30m00', '88.5GHz', 'Q']. If
   the order of the fits files ins not ra, dec, stokes, freq,
   **imtrans** can be used to change the order.
   
   If your input image does not provide a beam or you want to
   override it, you can provde a list of values to be used to define
   the synthesized beam [BMAJ,BMIN,BPA] (as in the FITS keywords) in
   the parameter *beam*. Note that the FITS keywords typically list
   the BMAJ, BMIN and BPA in degrees, but they can be specified with
   other units in importfits. Example: beam=['0.35arcsec',
   '0.24arcsec', '25deg']
   

.. _Examples:

Examples
   A straightforward implementation of **importfits**:
   
   ::
   
      importfits(fitsimage='ngc3256.fits', imagename='ngc3256.im',
                 overwrite=True)
   
   Though the user may wish to explicitly set (or re-set), for
   example, the beam characteristics:
   
   ::
   
      importfits(fitsimage='ngc3256.fits', imagename='ngc3256.im',
                 overwrite=True, beam=['0.35arcsec', '0.24arcsec', '25deg'])
   
   Which will force the BMIN, BMAX and BPA parameters to be 0.35",
   0.24" and 25 degrees, respectively.
