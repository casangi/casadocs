Description
   This task provides for initialization of the weight information in
   the MS. An overview on weights in CASA is provided in the `Data
   Weights <../../notebooks/data_weights.ipynb>`__
   section of CASAdocs. For ALMA interferometry and EVLA data, it
   should not generally be necessary to use this task, as the
   per-spectral window weight information should have been
   initialized properly at fill time (v4.2.2 and later). To set
   per-channel weights, use
   initweights(vis=finalvis,wtmode='weight',dowtsp=True).
   
   Several initialization modes are supported via the *wtmode*
   parameter. If *wtmode='nyq'* (the default), the SIGMA and WEIGHT
   will be initialized according to bandwidth and integration time.
   This is the theoretically correct mode for raw normalized
   visibilities (e.g., ALMA). For the EVLA, this is correct if
   switched-power and bandpass calibration will later be applied.
   If *wtmode='sigma'*, WEIGHT will be initialized according to
   the existing SIGMA column. If *wtmode='weight'*, WEIGHT_SPECTRUM
   will be initialized according to the existing WEIGHT column;
   *dowtspec=True* must be specified in this case. If
   *wtmode='ones'*, SIGMA and WEIGHT will be initialized with
   1.0, globally. This is a traditional means of initializing
   weight information, and is adequate when the integration time
   and bandwidth are uniform. It is not recommended for
   modern instruments (ALMA, EVLA), where variety in observational
   setups is common, and properly initialized and calibrated
   weights will be used for imaging sensitivity estimates.

   There are two EXPERIMENTAL modes, *wtmode='tsys'* and
   *'tinttsys'*. In the modes, SIGMA and WEIGHT will be initialized
   according to :math:`T_{sys}`, bandwidth :math:`\Delta\nu`, and
   integration time :math:`t_{int}` (used only in
   '*tinttsys*'), i.e.:
   
   -  *tsys* : :math:`weight=\frac{\Delta\nu}{T_{sys}^2}`
   -  *tinttsys*:
      :math:`weight=\frac{\Delta\nu \, t_{int}}{T_{sys}^2}`
   
   These modes use Tsys values to calculate weight as is done in Tsys
   calibration. Tsys values are taken from a Tsys calibration table
   given as *tsystable*. Selection of gain field
   (*gainfield*), interpolation method (*interp*), and spectral
   window mapping (*spwmap*) are supported, too.
   
   Available types of interpolation are:
   
   -  Time: '*nearest*', '*linear*', the variation of those with
      '*perobs*', e.g., '*linearperobs*' (enforce obsId boundaries in
      interpolation)
   -  Freq: '*nearest*', '*linear*', '*cubic*', '*spline*', and the
      variation of those with '*flag*', e.g., '*linearflag*'
      (with channelized flag).
   
   See the page of **applycal** for details of interpolations.
   
   .. warning:: **WARNING**: If the weight in an MS is initialized with these
      modes and Tsys calibration table is applied
      with *calwt=True* after that, the weight would be contaminated
      by being divided by the square of Tsys twice. !!! USERS ARE
      ADVISED TO USE THESE EXPERIMENTAL MODES WITH CARE !!!
   
   For the above *wtmodes*, if *dowtsp=True* (or if the
   WEIGHT_SPECTRUM column already exists), the WEIGHT_SPECTRUM column
   will be initialized (uniformly in channel in *wtmode='nyq',
   'sigma',* '*weight*', and '*ones*'), in a manner consistent with
   the disposition of the WEIGHT column. If the
   WEIGHT_SPECTRUM column does not exist, *dowtsp=True* will force
   its creation. Use of the WEIGHT_SPECTRUM column is only
   meaningful for ALMA data which will be calibrated with
   channelized Tsys information, or if the weights will become
   channelized after calibration, e.g., via averaging over time-
   and channel-dependent flagging (**statwt** is a task for
   channel-dependent weight estimation from the data itself). 
   
   In non-channelized modes (*wtmode='nyq', 'sigma', 'weight',*
   and '*ones*') or when *dowtsp=False,* the SIGMA_SPECTRUM column
   will be removed from the MS. On the other hand, the SIGMA_SPECTRUM
   column is added and initialized in channelized modes
   (*wtmode='tsys'* and '*tinttsys*') if *dowtsp=True* or if the
   WEIGHT_SPECTRUM already column exists.
   
   Two additional modes are available for managing the
   spectral weight info columns; these should be used with extreme
   care: If *wtmode='delwtsp'*, the WEIGHT_SPECTRUM column will be
   deleted (if it exists). If *wtmode='delsigsp',* the SIGMA_SPECTRUM
   column will be deleted (if it exists). Note that creation
   of SIGMA_SPECTRUM is not supported via this method.
   
   .. note:: **NOTE**: This task does not support any prior
      selection. Intialization of the weight information must
      currently be done globally or not at all. This is to maintain
      consistency.
   

.. _Examples:

Examples
   **Example 1:**
   
   Initialize the WEIGHT and the SIGMA column of myMS.ms based on the
   channel widths and integration time of each visibility.
   *dowtsp=True* will create a SIGMA_SPECTRUM and WEIGHT_SPECTRUM
   column if they did not exist in the original myMS.ms. 
   
   ::
   
      initweights(vis='myMS.ms', wtmode='nyq', dowtsp=True)

   
   **Example 2:**
   
   Use **initweights** to create WEIGHT_SPECTRUM column if it does
   not exist and fill the WEIGHT values into WEIGHT_SPECTRUM 
   
   ::
   
      initweights(vis='myMS.ms', wtmode='weight') 
   
    and here's a call that will remove the WEIGHT_SPECTRUM column,
   but keep WEIGHT
   
   ::
   
      initweights(vis='myMS.ms', wtmode='delwtsp')
