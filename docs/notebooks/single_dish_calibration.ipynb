        "Like any single-dish telescope, ALMA\\'s single dish antennas (nominally, four 12m antennas) detect and quantify brightness temperature ($T_B$, in Kelvin). In the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation, the Planck blackbody law reduces to $T_B=\\frac{B\\lambda^2}{2k}$.  \n",
        "\n",
        "An ALMA single-dish observation includes contributions from sky targets in the beam, the telescope surface and receiver equipment, the ground (through reflections), the atmosphere and cosmic background, and any other electronics (necessarily noisy) following the receiver front end. Observations made with a single dish towards a target ($T_{ON}$) are calibrated using an additional observation towards blank sky (i.e. sky at a similar elevation, absent of any target emission at the frequencies of interest to the observer ($T_{OFF}$)).\n",
        "\n",
        "To determine the signal from the target, we can compute:\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\frac{T_{targ}}{T_{sys}}=\\frac{T_{ON}-T_{OFF}}{T_{OFF}}$.   (In CASA, this is accomplished during the \\\"sky calibration\\\" step).\n",
        "\n",
        "The position of the OFF is made as close as possible (in az/el) to the ON position.  As a practical matter, there may be some differences in the two measurements aside from the target being in the ON position. In most cases, the differences arise chiefly from the atmospheric contribution, though any target coincidentally within the beam of the OFF measurement will contaminate and affect the accuracy of the OFF measurement, and consequently, the measurement of the calibrated brightness temperature of the target.\n",
        "\n",
        "To calibrate single dish data, we require a measurement of $T_{sys}$, which is done though $T_{atm}$ (i.e. \\\"atmosphere\\\") measurements at the start of each scheduling block.  (In CASA, this is applied through the $T_{sys}$ calibration step.)  $T_{sys}$ determination includes separate observations of the sky, and two \\\"loads\\\" of different, known temperatures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that $T_{sys}(\\nu)$ measurements are spectral; that is, they determine $T_{sys}$ as function of frequency. Since they incorporate an observation of the sky, they may include atmospheric features such as the water absorption line in Band 5 at $\\sim$183 GHz. So the calibration of the entire band must be done in the frequency domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is policy that ALMA single-dish data must only be observed to supplement and be combined with interferometer observations. Therefore, the single-dish data needs to be converted from its native units of brightness temperature ($T_A^*$) to flux density units (Jy/beam) before combination with the interferometric data. The conversion from $T_A^*$ to Jy/beam is done empirically, and incorporates a factor for forward beam efficiency. The empirical conversion (Jy to K) is computed through mapping observations (done recently in time) of a standard target - either a planet or a quasar - and the scaling from $T_A^*$ to Jy/beam is then made simply and directly from the calibrator map and applied to the science target map. \n",

        "\n",
        "At present, ALMA single dish observing has three modes: PS (position switched), OTF (on the fly), and OTF-raster (Rasterized on the fly). These have slightly different observation/scanning patterns, and also have differences in the cadence and position of the OFF measurements.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the case of the PS mode, the OFF position is specified by the PI before the observations.  The OFF positions have a specific and periodic cadence and should, where possible, be at approximately the same azimuth as the observations of the science target. Note that PS mode observations can include mapping observations, and this is actually the general mode for ALMA single-dish observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "For OTF-raster, the telescope scans the observing target, including some additional length on either side of the target.  The reference data are interpolated from the OFF positions at the edge of the scans. It is assumed that the bandpass profile varies slowly as a function of scan position. This mode yields a slightly better calibration than position switching, since the variation in the air mass is typically more consistent between the OFF data and the target.  At present, ALMA uses OTF-raster mode to calibrate observations of the amplitude (i.e. Jy-to-K) calibrators.\n",
        "\n",
        "For OTF mode, the observations are not rasterized.  The scanning pattern for OTF observations can take several forms.  Solar observations, for example, use a double-circle scan. In this case the entire periphery of the observed region is identified as an OFF measurement.  The OTF-raster mode, on the other hand, uses the first and last points of the raster rows as the OFF. A mean bandpass is formed from the OFF measurements, interpolated in time, and applied to any measurements not identified as OFF.  For OTF and OTF-raster, specific OFF posiotions are not explicitly nominated prior to the observations. \n",

While the steps are described in detail here, an example of the full single-dish calibration process can be found in the [M100 Band 3 Single Dish CASAguide](https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php/M100_Band3_SingleDish_4.3).\n",

        "\n",
        "It\\'s important at this point to define exactly what is meant by *baseline* in the context of single-dish data. In interferometry, *baseline* refers to the spatial separation of antenna pairs.  For a single dish observation, *baseline* refers to the spectral pattern produced by the atmosphere and instrument. Since single-dish antennas measure total power, not an interference pattern, they are responsive to emission wherever it exists within the single-dish beam or signal path. This signal is dominated by the receiver/correlator/backend sampling function, but has a significant time-varying component usually dominated by atmospheric fluctuations. The power yielded by atmospheric fluctuations are invisible to interferometer observations, as they are in the *near field*, and are therefore generally resolved out from the data.  Note, though, that the atmospheric variability can contaminate interferometric measurements by introducing a decoherence in phase, and such losses in phase are not relevant for single-dish observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**sdbaseline** removes a spectral baseline from the data on a per-integration basis. The options here are extensive, and baseline subtraction can be complex when emission is strongly variable throughout the map, or when there are nearby atmospheric absorption features.  But CASA is effective at choosing intelligent defaults with *mode=\\'auto\\'*. With *mode=\\'auto\\'*, CASA will examine the brightness variability per integration and determine the most appropriate channel ranges for computing the spectral baseline, based on the mean absolute deviation of the channels. This approach is successful even when applied to spectra crowded heavily with emission lines.  As long as the emission-free parts of the spectrum have statistically significant representation in the data, then the *mode=\\'auto\\'* will be successful. Baseline corrections employed by CASA are subtracted, and therefore can be applied iteratively, as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**sdbaseline** supports Polynomial, Chebychev and Sinusoid baseline removal. Sinusoidal baselines are determined with a Fourier transform of the spectral data - again, an automatic mode is available, where CASA will determine the most significant Fourier components and remove them, though specific wavenumbers can be explicitly added or removed on top of the automatic operation. Sinusoidal components occur in many single-dish telescopes, and are a typical manifestation of a standing-wave resonation of the main-reflector/subreflector cavity. ALMA has employed scattering cones in the single-dish subreflectors to effectively mitigate the strength of this standing wave. It\\'s worth noting that removal of Fourier components should be applied with utmost caution; the result is effectively a convolution of the spectra with a spectral filter, and MUST affect the resulting emission spectra. Users who use this baseline mode should explore and characterize the consequences and subsquent error propagation, in the context of their own data.In this example, we remove a 1st order polynomial from spectral windows 17, 19, 21 & 23, automatically finding and masking out any lines brighter than 5 $\\sigma$, and referencing the \\\"corrected\\\" (i.e. calibrated) data column.\n",

        "The top development priority for CASA single-dish data reduction is the conversion to the MeasurementSet format for the full reduction process. Dispensing with the ASAP (scan table) format will help unify data processing by providing a more homogenous basis for data processing, reduction, and analysis, as well as streamline and make more versatile the development aspects; current and future developers need only be familiar with one overall format of data. As such, ASAP will be gone in 5.1. However, please note that the **importasap** task is the only exception and will not go away even after removing ASAP. This task supports importing existing scantables in CASA for backward compatibility.There is also significant active development to add header information to plots made by **plotms**. While preserving the multi-plot capability and building a layout that will not cramp or obfuscate the plot output, header information (i.e. target name, frequency, integration time, etc.) can be optionally added to the plots output by **plotms**.There are a number of additional improvements that we do not detail here. ALMA-related development requests and bug notices can be sent to the CASA Single Dish Team via the [ALMA Helpdesk](https://help.almascience.org/).\n",
