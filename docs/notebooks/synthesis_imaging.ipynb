        "Image reconstruction in radio interferometry is the process of solving the linear system of equations $\\vec{V} = [A] \\vec{I}$, where $\\vec{V}$ represents visibilities calibrated for direction independent effects, $\\vec{I}$ is a list of parameters that model the sky brightness distribution (for example, a image of pixels) and $[A]$ is the measurement operator that encodes the process of how visibilities are generated when a telescope observes a sky brightness $\\vec{I}$.  $[A]$ is generally given by $[S_{dd}][F]$ where $[F]$ represents a 2D Fourier transform, and $[S_{dd}]$ represents a 2D spatial frequency sampling function that can include direction-dependent instrumental effects. For a practical interferometer with a finite number of array elements, $[A]$ is non-invertible because of unsampled regions of the $uv$ plane. Therefore, this system of equations must be solved iteratively, applying constraints via various choices of image parameterizations and instrumental models.\n",

        "The data to image transform is called the *imaging* step in which a pseudo inverse of $[S_{dd}][F]$ is computed and applied to the visibilities. Operationally, weighted visibilities are convolutionally resampled onto a grid of spatial-frequency cells, inverse Fourier transformed, and normalized. This step is equivalent to calculating the normal equations as part of a least squares solution. The image to data transform is called the *prediction* step and it evaluates the measurement equation to convert a model of the sky brightness into a list of model visibilities that are later subtracted from the data to form residual visibilities. For both transforms, direction dependent instrumental effects can be accounted for via carefully constructed convolution functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Iterations begin with an initial guess for the image model.  Each major cycle consists of the prediction of model visibilities, the calculation of residual visibilities and the construction of a residual image. This residual image contains the effect of incomplete sampling of the spatial-frequency plane but is otherwise normalized to the correct sky flux units. In its simplest form, it can be written as a convolution of the true sky image with a point spread function. The job of the minor cycle is to iteratively build up a model of the true sky by separating it from the point spread function. This step is also called *deconvolution* and is equivalent to the process of solving the normal equations as part of a least squares solution. Different reconstruction algorithms can operate as minor cycle iterations, allowing for flexibility in (for example) how the sky brightness is parameterized. The imaging step can be approximate in that several direction dependent effects, especially baseline, frequency or time-dependent ones can sometimes  ignored, minor cycles can be approximate in that they use only PSF patches and do not try to be accurate over the entire image, but the prediction step of the major cycle must be as accurate as possible such that model components are converted to visibilities by including all possible instrumental effects.\n",

The iterative framework described above is based on the Cotton-Schwab Clean algorithm [\\[3\\]](#Bibliography), but variants like Hogbom Clean [\\[1\\]](#Bibliography) and Clark Clean [\\[2\\]](#Bibliography) are available as subsets of this framework. The major cycle allows controls over different data weighting schemes [\\[10\\]](#Bibliography) and convolution functions that account for wide-field direction-dependent effects during imaging and prediction \\[[\\[6\\]](#Bibliography), [\\[7\\]](#Bibliography) , [\\[8\\]](#Bibliography)\\]. Deconvolution options include the use of point source vs multi-scale image models [\\[4\\]](#Bibliography) , narrow-band or wide-band models [\\[5\\]](#Bibliography), controls on iteration step size and stopping criteria, and external constraints such as interactive and non-interactive image masks. Mosaics may be made with data from multiple pointings, either with each pointing imaged and deconvolved separately before being combined in a final step, or via a joint imaging and deconvolution [\\[9\\]](#Bibliography).

The user can adjust the weighting using **clean** and changing the *weighting* parameter with six options: \\'natural\\', \\'uniform\\', \\'briggs\\',  \\'superuniform\\', \\'briggsabs\\', and \\'radial\\'. Optionally, a UV taper can be applied, and various parameters can be set to further adjust the weight calculations.\n",

Since usually, lower spatial frequencies are sampled more often than the higher ones, the inner uv-plane will have a significantly higher density of samples and hence signal-to-noise than the outer uv-plane. The resulting \\\"density-upweighting\\\" of the inner uv-plane will produce the largest angular resolution and can sometimes result in undesirable structure in the PSF which reduces the accuracy of the minor cycle. However, at the location of a source, this method preserves the natural point-source sensitivity of the instrument.\n",

        "For *weighting=\\'natural\\'*, visibilities are weighted only by the data weights, which are calculated during filling and calibration and should be equal to the inverse noise variance on that visibility. Imaging weight $w_i$ of sample $\\dot\\imath$ is given by:\n",

The resulting PSF has the narrowest possible main lobe (i.e. smallest possible angular resolution) and suppressed sidelobes across the entire image and is best suited for sources with high signal-to-noise ratios to minimize sidelobe contamination between sources. However, the peak sensitivity is significantly worse than optimal (typically \\~20% worse for reasonably large number of antenna interferometers), since data points in densely sampled regions have been weighted down to make the weights uniform. Also, isolated measurements can get artifically high relative weights and this may introduce further artifacts into the PSF.\n",

        "For *weighting=\\'uniform\\'*, the data weights are calculated as in \\'natural\\' weighting. The data is then gridded to a number of cells in the uv-plane, and after all data is gridded the uv-cells are re-weighted to have \"uniform\" imaging weights. This pumps up the influence on the image of data with low weights (they are multiplied up to be the same as for the highest weighted data), which sharpens resolution and reduces the sidelobe level in the field-of-view, but increases the rms image noise. No sub-parameters are linked to this mode choice.\n",

When using *Briggs* style weight with *perchanweightdensity=True*, the imaging weight density calculations use only the weights of data that contribute specifically to that channel. On the other hand, when *perchanweightdensity=False*, the imaging weight density calculations sum all of the weights from all of the data channels selected whose (u,v) falls in a given uv cell on the weight density grid. Since the aggregated weights, in any given uv cell, will change depending on the number of channels included when imaging, the psf calculated for a given frequency channel will also necessarily change, resulting in variability in the psf for a given frequency channel when *perchanweightdensity=False*. In general, *perchanweightdensity=False* results in smaller psfs for the same value of robustness compared to *perchanweightdensity=True*, but the rms noise as a function of channel varies and increases toward the edge channels; *perchanweightdensity=True* provides more uniform sensitivity per channel for cubes.

For example, snap-shot ALMA mosaics with *mosweight = False* typically show an increase in noise in the corners or in the areas furthest away from the phase-center.

It is equivalent to smoothing the PSF obtained by other weighting schemes and can be specified either as a Gaussian in uv-space (eg. units of lambda or klambda) or as a Gaussian in the image domain (eg. angular units like arcsec).

A small value (e.g. *pblimit=0.01*) can be used to increase the region of the sky actually imaged. For *gridder='standard'*, there is no pb-based normalization during gridding and so the value of this parameter is ignored.The sign of the pblimit parameter is used for a different purpose. If positive, it defines a T/F pixel mask that is attached to the output residual and restored images.  If negative, this T/F pixel mask is not included.  Please note that this pixel mask is different from the deconvolution mask used to control the region where CLEAN based algorithms will search for source peaks.  In order to set a deconvolution mask based on pb level, please use the \\'pbmask\\' parameter.Based on the above, please note that certain values of pblimit to avoid, are 1, -1, and 0. When the pblimit is set to 1 the entire image is masked as the user is specifying that no normalization or deconvolution happens if the PB gain is lower than 1, which leads to the entire image being masked. Setting the pblimit to -1 also results in no deconvolution as mentioned in the case where pblimit is 1 but there is no masking of the image.

This form of normalization is particularly useful for mosaic imaging where the sky brightness can extend across many pointings, or if there is an uneven distribution of weights across pointings. This is because joint mosaics are usually done for sources with spatial scales larger than the field-of-view of each antenna and which are not explicitly present in the measured data.

The output is an incremental model image that defines the \\'step\\' taken during the chi-square minimization process. In the next major cycle, the contribution of this model image is subtracted out of the list of visibilities and the result is regridded and transformed to produce a new residual image. This approach allows for a practical trade-off between the efficiency of operating in the image domain (or simply with gridded visibilities) and the accuracy that comes from returning to the ungridded list of visibilities after every \\'step\\'. It also allows for minor cycle algorithms that have their own internal optimization schemes (i.e. they need not be strict chi-square minimizations) with their own control parameters. Note that any minor cycle algorithm that can operate on gridded visibilities can fit into this framework. The inputs to the minor cycle algorithm are the residual image, psf and perhaps a starting model. Outputs are a model image.\n",

In all cases, the the sky brightness is parameterized in a sparse basis such that in practice, the minor cycle algorithm needs only to search for the location and amplitude of peaks. This makes it efficient. For example, fields of compact sources are best represented by delta function locations and amplitudes. Extended emission is modeled as a linear combination of components of different scale sizes and transformed into a multi-scale basis where again, delta functions are all that are required to mark the location and amplitude of blobs of different sizes. Multi-term algorithms for wideband imaging model the sky brightness and its spectrum simultaneously, using coefficients of a Taylor polynomial as a sparse representation of a smooth spectrum. In this case, the location of each (multi-scale) component is chosen via a search and the values of the Taylor coefficients for that component are solved for via a direct linear least squares calculation.\n",

This algorithm is efficient in that delta functions are optimal for fields of compact sources, but susceptible to errors due to inappropriate choices of imaging weights, especially if the PSF has high sidelobes. It uses the full PSF during its update step to ensure that the next residual is as accurate as possible, but this can get compute intensive.  \n",

The first is that it does its residual image updates using only a small patch of the PSF. This is an approximation that will result in a significant speed-up in the minor cycle, but could introduce errors in the image model if there are bright sources spread over a wide field-of-view where the flux estimate at a given location is affected by sidelobes from far-out sources. The second difference is designed to compensate for the above. The iterations are stopped when the brightest peak in the residual image is below the first sidelobe level of the brightest source in the initial residual image and the residual image is re-computed by subtracting the sources and their responses in the gridded Fourier domain (to eliminate aliasing errors). Image domain peak finding and approximate subtractions resume again.

For mosaics of extended emission, it is sometimes possible to use large scale sizes in the minor cycle if there are enough connected structures across pointings, but since there still is no actual short spacing uv data to constrain those scales, they should be used with caution.

This noise estimate is computationally fast, but may be less accurate for cases where the emission covers a large fraction (nominally 50%) of the field of view. In CASA 5.5, a new noise estimate was introduced, which uses a more complex and computationally expensive noise estimate. This estimate may yield more accurate estimates of the noise in the case where emission covers a significant fraction of the field of view. The procedure is as follows. If there is no mask, remove pixels from the noise distribution via Chauvenet\\'s criterion [\\[24\\]](#Bibliography)  [\\[25\\]](#Bibliography) and then estimate the noise using the remaining pixels via the median absolute deviation. If there is a mask, then calculate the noise from the pixels outside the clean mask and inside the primary beam mask, which we refer to as the masked MAD.

In the limit of perfect deconvolution and noise-like residuals, this number can be accurate. However, in practice, deconvolution artifacts usually remain in the residual image (especially underneath extended emission) and they dominate the errors. In general, the spectral index error map should only be used as a guide of which regions of the image to trust relative to others, and not to use the absolute value of error for scientific analysis.  A more useful error estimate can be derived by repeating the imaging run (especially if it involves multi-scale components) with slightly different settings of scale sizes and iteration controls, to see what is true signal and what can be attributed to reconstruction uncertainty.  For high signal-to-noise compact sources, error limits of $\\pm 0.05$ can be achieved. For complicated extended emission at about SNR=100 or less, typical errors are about $\\pm 0.2$.  These errors are highly correlated with how appropriately the scale sizes are chosen, with errors ranging from $\\pm 0.1$ or less up to $\\pm 0.5$ in the limit of using delta functions to try to model extended emission.\n",

The main disadvantage is that the angular resolution of all higher frequency channels must be degraded to that of the lowest frequency before any combined analysis can be done.

An appropriate value of wprojplanes depends on whether there is a bright source far from the phase center, the desired dynamic range of an image in the presence of a bright far out source, the maximum w-value in the measurements, and the desired trade off between accuracy and computing cost. As a (rough) guide, VLA L-Band D-config may require a value of 128 for a source 30arcmin away from the phase center. A-config may require 1024 or more. To converge to an appropriate value, try starting with 128 and then increasing it if artifacts persist. W-term artifacts (for the VLA) typically look like arc-shaped smears in a synthesis image or a shift in source position between images made at different times. These artifacts are more pronounced the further the source is from the phase center. There is no harm in simply always choosing a large value (say, 1024) but there will be a significant performance cost to doing so, especially for *gridder='awproject'* where it is combined with A-Projection. *wprojplanes=-1* may be used with *gridder='widefield'* or *'wproject'* to automatically compute the number of planes.\n",

These pointing errors in general also vary significantly across the array and with time. Corrections to the true antenna pointing directions are contained in the POINTING sub-table, and if these corrections are present and accurate, they can be used to improve imaging of both single-pointing and mosaic fields. These heterogeneous pointing corrections are controlled by two parameters in **tclean**:\n",

A compute for a new phase gradient is triggered for a bin if the length of the mean pointing vector of the antennas in the bin changes by more than the second value. The default value of this parameter is \\[\\], due a programmatic constraint. If run with this value, it will internally pick \\[600,600\\] and exercise the option of using large tolerances (10arcmin) on both axes.
