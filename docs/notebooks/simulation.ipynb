        "The capability of simulating observations and data sets from VLA, ALMA, and other existing and future observatories is an important use-case for CASA. This not only allows the user to get an idea of the capabilities of these instruments for doing science, but also provides benchmarks for the performance and utility of the software to process \"realistic\" data sets (with atmospheric and instrumental effects). Simulations can also be used to tune parameters of the data reduction and therefore help to optimize the process. CASA can calculate visibilities (create a MeasurementSet) for any interferometric array, and calculate and apply calibration tables representing some of the most important corrupting effects. \n",

Since the ACA total power array always observes larger areas compared to the ALMA 12-m and ACA 7-m arrays, it is possible that the ACA total power array cannot cover all pointings in the given observation time. In such a case, the integration time in the total power simulation is scaled so that the all pointings are observed at least once in its observation time, i.e., integration_TP = tptime / (the number of total power pointings).\n",

The relative weight of ACA 7-m visibilities is defined in proportion to the ratio of beam areas squared, i.e., $(7/12)^{4} = 0.11$.

For hexagonal or square maptypes, the *relmargin* (default=0.5) parameter affects the number of pointings returned in the mosaic pattern.
