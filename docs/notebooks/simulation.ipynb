    "An introduction to simulating observations in CASA\n",
    "\n",
    "The capability of simulating observations and data sets from VLA, ALMA, and other existing and future observatories is an important use-case for CASA. This not only allows the user to get an idea of the capabilities of these instruments for doing science, but also provides benchmarks for the performance and utility of the software to process \"realistic\" data sets (with atmospheric and instrumental effects). Simulations can also be used to tune parameters of the data reduction and therefore help to optimize the process. CASA can calculate visibilities (create a MeasurementSet) for any interferometric array, and calculate and apply calibration tables representing some of the most important corrupting effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks available for simulating observations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **simobserve** --- simulate and create custom synthetic MeasurementSets for an interferometric or total power observation\n",
    "-   **simanalyze** --- image and analyze simulated data set, including diagnostic images and plots\n",
    "-   **simalma** --- simulate an ALMA observation including multiple configurations of the 12-m interferometric array, the 7-m ACA, and total power measurements by streamlining the capabilities of both **simobserve** and **simanalyze**\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "**Inside the Toolkit:** The simulator methods are in the **simulator** tool **sm**. Many of the other CASA tools are helpful when constructing and analyzing simulations. Following general CASA practice, the greatest flexibility and functionality is available in the Toolkit, and the most commonly used procedures are bundled for convenience into the tasks.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "**Utility functions**: The **simutil** python class contains numerous utility methods which can be used to facilitate simulations, especially when using the Toolkit.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulating interferometric observations using the **simobserve** and **simanalyze** tasks proceeds in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. Make a model image or component list. The model is a representation of the sky brightness distribution that you would like to simulate observing (details on model specification in the **simobserve** documentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Use the **simobserve** task to create a MeasurementSet (uv data) that would be measured by a telescope observing the specified input model of sky brightness. **simobserve** can also introduce corruption modeling thermal noise or atmospheric effects. The task can be called multiple times to generate e.g., observations from the same model using different array configurations. **simobserve** can also simulate total power observations, which can be combined with interferometric data in **simanalyze**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. Image (grid, invert, and deconvolve) the simulated observation(s) with the **simanalyze** task. **simanalyze** can also compare the simulated image with your input (convolved with the output clean beam) and then calculate a \\\"fidelity image\\\" that indicates how well the simulated output matches the convolved input image.  Alternately, you can create an image yourself with the **tclean** task, and then use **simanalyze** to compare that to the sky model input.\n",
    "\n",
    "ALMA users, especially those less familiar with CASA, are encouraged to use the **simalma** task, which provides additional information on the multiple **simobserve** and **simanalyze** calls required to simulate an ALMA observation which may consist of 12m interferometric, 7m interferometric, and 12m total power data, and attempts to provide useful feedback on those different observation components, to help the user better understand the observing considerations. \n",
    "\n",
    "More simulation examples can be found in the CASA guides <http://casaguides.nrao.edu>, under \"Simulating Observations in CASA\". It is possible to run the steps independently and optionally, as long as you follow the **simobserve** and **simanalyze** conventions about filenames.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "**Tip**: A list of antenna configuration files known to CASA is linked from the simulation CASA guides. On Unix, Linux, and Mac computers, you can usually also find this list yourself by typing, for instance, \"locate alma.cycle4.1.cfg\" and looking at other files in that directory.\n",

    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The task **simalma** simulates an ALMA observation by ALMA 12-m, ACA-7m and total power arrays. It takes an input model image or a list of components, plus configurations of ALMA antennas (locations and sizes), and simulates a particular ALMA observation (specified by mosaic setup and observing cycles and times). The outputs are MeasurementSets. The task optionally generates images from the MeasurementSets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically speaking, **simalma** internally calls **simobserve** and **simanalyze** as many times as necessary to simulate and analyze an ALMA observation. Some of the simulation and imaging parameters are automatically set to values typical of ALMA observations. Thus, it has a simpler task interface compared to **simobserve** plus **simanalyze** at the cost of limited flexibility. If the user wants to have more control of simulation setup, it is available by manually running **simobserve** and **simanalyze** multiple times or by using the **simulator** (sm) tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "**WARNING**: The task **simalma** is designed to only be invoked once for a simulation setup. It always sets up a *skymodel* and pointings. That means that **simalma** is not supposed to be run multiple times for a project, unlike **simobserve** and **simanalyze**. The task **simalma** may ignore or overwrite the old results when it is run more than once with the same project name.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are options in **simalma** to simulate observation of ACA 7-m and total power arrays, to apply thermal noise, and/or to generate images from simulated MeasurementSets. One inputs a vector of configurations, and a corresponding vector of total times to observe each component. Thermal noise is added to visibilities when *pwv* \\> 0 . The ATM atmospheric model is constructed from the characteristics of the ALMA site and a user defined Precipitable Water Vapour (*pwv*) value. Set *pwv = 0* to omit the thermal noise. Finally, when *image = True*, synthesized images are generated from the simulated MeasurementSets.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Antenna Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "The configurations of the ALMA 12-m and 7-m arrays are defined by the *antennalist* parameter, which can be a vector. Each element of the vector can be either the name of an antenna configuration file or a desired resolution, e.g., *'alma;cycle1;5arcsec'*. Some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   *antennalist = \\['alma.cycle2.5.cfg','aca.cycle2.i.cfg'\\]; totaltime = \\['20min','2h'\\]'*: Will observe the 12-m array in configuration C32-5 for 20 minutes and the ACA 7-m array for 2 hours.\n",
    "-   *antennalist = \\['alma;cycle2;0.5arcsec','aca.i.cfg'\\]; totaltime = \\['20min','2h'\\]':* Will observe the 12-m array in whatever Cycle 2 configuration yields a zenith synthesized beam as close as possible to 0.5 arcsec (at the center frequency of your skymodel) for 20 minutes and the ACA 7-m array for 2 hours.   \n",
    "-   *antennalist = \\['alma.cycle1.2.cfg','aca.cycle2.i.cfg'\\]; totaltime = '20min'*: Will observe the 12-m array in Cycle 1 configuration 2 for 20 minutes and the ACA 7-m array for the default of 2×(12-m time) = 1h20min. This parameter setting will also generate a warning that the user is combining configurations from different ALMA Cycles (but the simulation will run despite that).\n",
    "\n",
    "Total power can either be included along with interferometric configurations e.g., *antennalist = \\['alma.cycle1.2.cfg','aca.cycle2.i.cfg','aca.tp.cfg'\\]*, or by using the *tpnant* and *tptime* parameters. The latter is preferred since it allows greater control (in particular the number of total power antennas to use -- if more than one is used, multiple total power observations will be generated and combined in imaging).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Field Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to setup pointings, i.e., Rectangle Setup and Multi-Pointing.In the Rectangle Setups, pointings are automatically calculated from the pointing center (direction) and the map size. A rectangular map region is covered by a hexagonal grid (*maptype = 'alma'*) with Nyquist sampling, i.e., 0.48 primary beam (PB) spacing (where PB ≡ 1.2 λ / D), in both ALMA 12-m and ACA 7-m array simulations. A slightly larger area is mapped in ACA total power simulations for later combination with interferometer visibilities. The map area is extended by 1 PB in each direction and covered by a lattice grid with 0.225 PB spacing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Multi-Pointing, a list of pointings is defined in the *direction* parameter or read from a file (when *setpointings = False*; note that **simobserve** can read ALMA OT pointing files in the old and new format but the latter only when they are saved as sexagesimal absolute positions). The ALMA 12-m and ACA 7-m arrays observe the specified directions. The ACA total power simulations map either (1) square regions of 2 PB extent centered at each of the pointings, or (2) a rectangle region that covers all the pointings. Either (1) or (2), whichever can be done with the smaller number of points, is selected. The pointing spacing in total power simulations is, again, 0.225 PB in lattice grids.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is advisable that for Total Power Simulations, the field is chosen sufficiently large, maybe padding at least 1-2 primary beams on each side.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Integration time\n",
    "\n",
    "The total observation time of each component or configuration is defined by the *totaltime* parameter as noted above. A scalar will trigger use of the Cycle 2 default time multipliers, 1:0.5:2:4 for the first 12-m configuration, any additional 12-m configurations, any 7-m configuration, and any total power observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the integration time (dump interval) of simulations is defined by the integration parameter with an exception. Since the ACA total power array always observes larger areas compared to the ALMA 12-m and ACA 7-m arrays, it is possible that the ACA total power array cannot cover all pointings in the given observation time. In such a case, the integration time in the total power simulation is scaled so that the all pointings are observed at least once in its observation time, i.e., integration_TP = tptime / (the number of total power pointings).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Imaging and combination of ALMA with ACA\n",
    "\n",
    "The CLEAN algorithm is used in **simalma** to generate images from visibilities. The visibilities are weighted to UV-plane using Briggs weighting.When ACA observations are simulated, visibilities of ACA 7-m are weighted by the relative sensitivities to ALMA 12-m visibilities, and both data sets are concatenated before imaging. The relative weight of ACA 7-m visibilities is defined in proportion to the ratio of beam areas squared, i.e., $(7/12)^{4} = 0.11$. This is because **simalma** uses a bandwidth and an integration time common to both ALMA 12-m and ACA 7-m simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interferometer and total power images are combined using **feather** task when total power observations are included. The total power image is scaled by the interferometer primary beam coverage before combination. The final image product is the combined image corrected for the interferometer primary beam coverage. The output image of the **feather** task is divided by the interferometer primary beam coverage in the final step.\n",

    "\n",
    "**simutil.modifymodel** is a method that converts a model image into a 4D-coordinate image that can be used in CASA, with axes in space, stokes, spectral order, which the Toolkit requires (e.g., **sm.predict** in the **simulator** tool). The input parameters *inimage* and *outimage* allow the user to specify the names of the input and output. Values that are absent in the input, or that the user wishes to override, can be input as quantity strings with the in\\* parameters (*inbright*, *indirection*, *incell*, *incenter*, *inwidth*, *innchan*). e.g., *inbright*=\\\"4Jy/pixel\\\" will scale *outimage* to have 4Jy/pixel peak, *incell*=\\\"0.2arcsec\\\" will set the cell size in *outimage* to 0.2arcsec. The *flatimage* parameter allows one to also generate a flat (2D, integrated intensity) image from *inimage*, which can be useful for display purposes.\n",

This is useful to compare a skymodel with a simulated output image. The optional parameter *complist* allows the user to import a componentlist to add unresolved components to the *outflat* image. Information on creating a component list can be found in the CASA guides [here](https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php/Simulation_Guide_Component_Lists_(CASA_5.1)).\n",
