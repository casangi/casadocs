In the guide [TCLEAN and ALMA](https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php?title=TCLEAN_and_ALMA), the differences in syntax between clean and tclean are made more explicit. For reference, legacy first look guides for older versions of CASA that use clean rather than tclean or interactive clean for imaging are kept in [Archived ALMA CASAguides](https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php?title=Archived_ALMA_CASAguides).\n",

    "\n",
    "- We will first image the phase calibrator, and set the image name to \"phase_cal\". To identify the phase calibrator in a measurement set, look at the 'ScanIntent' column in the output of listobs. The phase calibrator should have the intent \"CALIBRATE_PHASE#ON_SOURCE\". In this MS, the phase calibrator is J1037-295, identified by field = \"3\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will use multifrequency synthesis (specmode = mfs) to make a single continuum image. Multifrequency synthesis combines data from all selected spectral channels into a single continuum image. If your observations cover a large frequency range, it is possible that the amplitude or structure of the source can change substantially with frequency. This is only a concern if the fractional bandwidth (delta_nu/nu_center) is greater than 10%. For this dataset it is not an issue. Therefore, we set deconvolver=hogbom, which uses nterms=1, telling tclean that each deconvolved component has a single amplitude at all frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will image a single pointing, so we set gridder='standard'. If we had multiple, contiguous pointings-- or if we were simultaneously imaging 7m and 12m array data (even if only a single pointing of each)--- we would need to set gridder='mosaic'.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We set the cell size to 0.1 arcseconds, which places ~5 pixels across a beam. As a rule of thumb, we'd like ~5 pixels across the smallest direction of our elliptical beam. For a small dataset, you may be able to determine a good cell size with a quick imaging call, and note the beam calculated by tclean. For many ALMA projects, however, this could take a substantial amount of time! You can estimate what the cell size should be by looking again at the uv-coverage. Change the x-axis to uvwave, and the cell size is roughly 206265/(longest baseline in wavelengths)/(number of cells across the beam). For this MS, this works out to 0.09\", which we round up to 0.1\". As you will see, tclean reports a synthesized beam size of 0.58\" x 0.51\", making this choice just right.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We set the image size to 128x128 (but note that factors of 2 are not magic for CASA). This is enough to cover most of the primary beam at the observing frequency, but we might want to image a wider field for a non-point source. Image sizes can be arbitrary but should be symmetrical. Good practice is probably to round up to the nearest 10 or 100 pixels and if tclean does not like your choice, it will recommend in the logger window a better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the tclean task will *NOT* run in interactive mode. For users familiar with clean, note that in contrast with the clean task, leaving niter (the maximum number of iterations) unset defaults to niter=0, and tclean is being told not to do any cleaning. If there are no clean components in the model -- for instance if this is the first invocation of tclean on this field and spectral window for the given set of visibilities (MS) -- then what will be created is the dirty cube or image.

    "\n",
    "Next, we'll actually run tclean on the image in non-interactive mode. This non-interactive mode can save you a lot of time and has the advantage of being very reproducible. Note, however, that best practice for an image with uncertain calibration and especially one with a bright source, is to clean interactively at least the first time. In the case where an image may be \"dynamic range limited\" (i.e., the quality is set by the accuracy of calibration and deconvolution) it can be hard to predict the correct threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "For non-interactive tclean, the three main parameters to specify are the threshold at which to stop (when the maximum residual in the tclean region is lower than this threshold, tclean stops), the mask (the region in which tclean is willing to identify signal), and the maximum number of iterations. The max iterations is not strictly required and it is generally recommended that it be used as more of a failsafe. That is, set it to a number so high that if tclean gets there something has gone wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's take a stab at determining a clean mask. Look at the image you just made. All of the obvious emission is contained in a box that is bounded by pixel numbers in a range of something like (60,60) to (70,70). We'll set that box to be a mask using the \"mask\" parameter in the call to tclean. You could also set it by supplying a file (for example, one created from an earlier interactive version of tclean).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's determine a stopping threshold for tclean. A clean threshold several times the rms noise is usually recommended to avoid adding false sources to the deconvolved image. For this tutorial, let's set the threshold to 7mJy (a number determined by doubling the RMS noise of an off-source region of the image). That is, you do not want tclean to treat a random noise spike as a source and deconvolve it from the image. This can be particularly problematic if you are doing self-calibration (a later lesson). Finally set niter=10000, which is a lot of iterations. We expect tclean to terminate before reaching this. For our purposes this is just a big number that's designed to keep tclean from running forever."

As the final step in the basic imaging tutorial, let's now image the continuum in TW Hydra. First, we will \"split out\" the science data into its own data set using the CASA task split. While not strictly necessary, this is a common step that makes managing the data easier. At the same time we will smooth (i.e. average) the data in frequency using width=8 to do the averaging. This reduces the data volume without losing much information, since we are really only interested in continuum imaging at this point. Although this data set was already designed to be manageable, this smoothing trick is good to keep in mind because ALMA can produce very large data sets."

Yes, the spectral window that we have imaged here as continuum also contains a N2H+ emission line. In this case, the N2H+ emission is faint enough that neglecting to flag the line channels before imaging makes no difference to the final continuum image. For this and the other continuum first look tutorials, we have thus ignored the line to focus on the basic steps of imaging and self-calibration. In general, however, you should flag channels containing emission lines in your own data prior to imaging the continuum. To see how to flag line emission prior to imaging the continuum in a spectral window, please see the more advanced tutorial at IRAS16293_Band9_-_Imaging."

To establish the necessary websocket connections when running Interactive Clean, it'll prompt you with an ssh command that handles the port forwarding between your local computer and the remote server. If you're running IC locally, ignore this step and immediately hit `Enter`. Once you've properly established port forwarding (if necessary), hit the 'Enter' or 'Return' key when the input box to the right of the message is in focus (this should automatically be the case).\n",

It's a [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) plot, so you can move the plot up/down/left/right or zoom in and out.

You may need to click on the icon showing the \"R\" in an oval. Remember that the secondary calibrator has been selected because it is a point source, so at this point you should see a point source in the middle of the field. Draw an oval mask around the emission region (just the central dot). Double click inside the oval and watch it turn white (See Figure 2). When setting the clean mask, you should aim to capture the real emission and not much else. \n",

    "In the \"Next Action\" section of the GUI, you will notice several control buttons. Hit the green circle button to begin the cleaning process. This will run a major cycle of cleaning and then return. After the first round of cleaning, the plot displays the residual emission after the major cycle. Compare the brightness of the residuals with that of the source. When you are satisfied (or when tclean has met the residual threshold, 0 mJy by default - meaning that it stops at the first negative), click the red \"X\" and tclean will terminate. In this example, two rounds of cleaning work well. For more complex targets you may need many rounds of cleaning, and it is possible to update and add new tclean regions after each major cycle, based on the look of the residuals.\n",

    "\n",
    "An important subtlety of tclean (and clean) is that by default the image produced by tclean is not corrected for the primary beam (the field of view) of the individual dishes in the array. The primary beam response is typically a Gaussian with value 1 at the center of the field. To form an astronomically correct image of the sky, the output of tclean needs to be divided by this primary beam (or, in the case of mosaics, the combination of primary beam patterns used to make the mosaic). For tclean, there are two ways to do this.\n",
