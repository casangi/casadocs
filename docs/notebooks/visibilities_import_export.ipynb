In this context an IF (Intermediate Frequency) is a specialization of an SpW, where each IF in a UV FITS file must have the same number of channels and polarizations, each channel must have the same width, and each IF must be present (even if flagged) throughout the entire observation. If these conditions are not met the data must be exported using multiple FREQIDs, the UV FITS equivalent of a general SpW. This matters since many (sub)programs will work with multiple IFs, but not multiple FREQIDs. For example, a UV FITS file with multiple FREQIDs can be read by AIPS, but you may find that you have to separate the FREQIDs with SPLIT before you can do very much with them.
