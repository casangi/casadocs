In CASA 4.5, our intent is to demonstrate the Cal Library and begin familiarizing users with it.

Instead of specifying the traditional parameters, the file name is specified in the *callib* parameter in **applycal** or **plotms** (in **applycal** one must also specifiy *docallib=True*).  For example, to correct an MS called *my.ms*, with a Cal Library file called *mycal.txt*:\n",

Extending the example from above, if the MS field *\\'cal\\'* should be calibrated by *cal.G* with *\\'nearest\\'* interpolation in time, and the field *\\'sci\\'* with *\\'linear\\'* interpolation in time, the following Cal Library file will achieve this:\n",

In general, it is best to specify *calwt* (or rely on the default, *True*) uniformly for all entries, per caltable, to avoid confusion.

This sort of row consolidation is optional, but it may have useful memory efficiency benefits when running **applycal**, and so is recommended.The **applycaltocallib** function should be considered experimental and used with care, and the resulting file examined thoroughly for correctness, since this function will not do any internal duplication checking or other sanity checks.
