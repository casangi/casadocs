        "The \\\"Cal Library\\\" is a new means of expressing calibration application instructions.  It has nominally been available in **applycal** and the calibration solve tasks since CASA 4.1, via the *docallib=True* parameter, as an alternative to the traditional parameters (e.g., *gaintable*, etc.)  that most users continue to use.  As of CASA 4.5, we have deployed use of the Cal Library for *on-the-fly* calibration in **plotms** and **mstransform**.  In CASA 4.5, our intent is to demonstrate the Cal Library and begin familiarizing users with it.  The capabilities remain limited in some ways, and new features, additional flexibility, and broader deployment in more tasks will be offered in later releases.This page describes basic use of the Cal Library.\n",

Instead of specifying the traditional parameters, the file name is specified in the *callib* parameter in **applycal** or **plotms** (in **applycal** one must also specifiy *docallib=True*).

The *\\*map* parameters support other short-hand options as well, as indicated below.  For defaults, \\\"index identity\\\" means that each MS index will be calibrated by the corresponding caltable index, and \\\"no explicit mapping\\\" means that no filter will be applied to that axis, and all available solutions on the axis will be included.\n",
