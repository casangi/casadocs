        "This chapter explains how to calibrate interferometer data within the CASA task system.  Calibration is the process of determining the net complex correction factors that must be applied to each visibility in order to make them as close as possible to what an idealized interferometer would measure, such that when the data is imaged an accurate picture of the sky is obtained.  This is not an arbitrary process, and there is a philosophy behind the CASA calibration methodology.  For the most part, calibration in CASA using the tasks is not too different than calibration in other packages such as AIPS or Miriad.\n",

Anyway, it\\'s just matrix algebra, and your familiar scalar methods of calibration (such as in AIPS) are encompassed in this more general approach.\n",

        "-   **task parameters** \\-\\-- sometimes the calibration information is in the form of CASA task parameters that tell the calibration tasks to turn on or off various features, contain important values (such as flux densities), or list what should be done to the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "At its most basic level, Calibration in CASA is the process of taking \\\"uncalibrated\\\" **data**, setting up the operation of calibration tasks using **task parameters**, solving for new **calibration tables**, and then applying the calibration tables to form \\\"calibrated\\\" **data**.  Iteration can occur as necessary, e.g., to re-solve for an eariler **calibration table** using a better set of prior calibration, often with the aid of other non-calibration steps (e.g. imaging to generate improved source models for \\\"self-calibration\\\").\n",
        "\n",
        "The calibration tables are the currency that is exchanged between the calibration tasks.  The \\\"solver\\\" tasks (**gaincal**, **bandpass**, **blcal**, **polcal**) take in the MS (which may have a calibration model attached) and previous calibration tables, and will output an \\\"incremental\\\" calibration table (it is incremental to the previous calibration, if any).  This table can then be smoothed using **smoothcal** if desired.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final set of calibration tables represents the cumulative calibration and is what is applied to correct the data using **applycal**. It is important to keep track of each calibration table and its role relative to others.  E.g., a provisional gain calibration solution will usually be obtained to optimize a bandpass calibration solve, but then be discarded in favor of a new gain calibration solution that will itself be optimized by use of the bandpass solution as a prior; the original gain calibration table should be discarded in this case.   On the other hand, it is also permitted to generate a sequence of gain calibration tables, each *relative* to the last (and any other prior calibration used); in this case all relative tables should be carried forward through the process and included in the final **applycal**.  It is the user\\'s responsibility to keep track of the role of and relationships between all calibration tables.  Depending on the complexity of the observation, this can be a confusing business, and it will help if you adopt a consistent table naming scheme.  In general, it is desirable to minimize the number of different calibration tables of a specific type, to keep the overall process as simple as possible and minimize the computational cost of applying them, but relative calibraition tables may sometimes be useful as an aid to understanding the origin and properties of the calibration effects.  For example, it may be instructive to obtain a short time-scale gain calibraiton relative to a long time-scale one (e.g., obtained from a single scan) to approximatly separate electronic and atmospheric effects.  Of course, calibration tables of different types are necessarily relative to each other (in the order in which they are solved).\n",

In most other cases, sensitivity is, to a very good approximation, channel-independent after bandpass calibration (and often also before), except perhaps at the very edges of spectral windows (and for which analytic expressions of the sensitivity loss are generally unavailable).  Averaging of data with channel-dependent flagging which varies on sufficiently short timescales will also generate channel-dependent net weights (see **split** or **mstransform** for more details).\n",

This spectral average is formally correct for weight update by bandpass.  For $T_{sys}$, traditional treatments used a single measurement per spectral window; ALMA has implemented spectral $T_{sys}$ to better track sensitivity as a function of channel, and so should benefit from *spectral* weight accounting as described here, especially where atmospheric emmission lines occur.

The *dowtsp* parameter controls whether or not (*True* or *False*) the spectral weights (the *WEIGHT_SPECTRUM* column) are initialized.  The default is *dowtsp=False*, wherein only the non-spectral weights (the *WEIGHT* column) will be initialized.  If the spectral weights have been initialized, then downstream processing that supports spectral weights will use and update them.

Gain curve calibration involves compensating for the effects of elevation on the amplitude of the received signals at each antenna.  Antennas are not absolutely rigid, and so their effective collecting area and net surface accuracy vary with elevation as gravity deforms the surface.  This calibration is especially important at higher frequencies where the deformations represent a greater fraction of the observing wavelength.  By design, this effect is usually minimized (i.e., gain maximized) for elevations between 45 and 60 degrees, with the gain decreasing at higher and lower elevations.  Gain curves are most often described as 2nd- or 3rd-order polynomials in zenith angle.\n",

According to the physics of radiative transmission, the effect is threefold.  First, radio waves from astronomical sources are absorbed (and therefore attenuated) before reaching the antenna.  Second, since a good absorber is also a good emitter, significant noise-like power will be added to the overall system noise, and thus further decreasing the *fraction* of correlated signal from astrophysical sources.  Finally, the optical path length through the troposphere introduces a time-dependent phase error.  In all cases, the effects become worse at lower elevations due to the increased air mass through which the antenna is looking.  In CASA, the opacity correction described here compensates only for the first of these effects, tropospheric attenuation, using a plane-parallel approximation for the troposphere to estimate the elevation dependence.

        "\n",
        "CASA 4.3 introduced initial support for on-axis ionospheric corrections, using time- and direction-dependent total electron content (TEC) information obtained from the internet.  The correction includes the dispersive delay ($\\propto \\nu^{-1}$) delay and Faraday rotation ($\\propto \\nu^{-2}$) terms.  These corrections are most relevant at observing frequencies less than $\\sim$5 GHz.  When relevant, the ionosphere correction table should be generated at the beginning of a reduction along with other calibration priors (antenna position errors, gain curve, opacity, etc.), and carried through all subsequent calibration steps.  Formally, the idea is that the ionospheric effects (as a function of time and on-axis direction) will be nominally accounted for by this calibration table, and thus not spuriously leak into gain and bandpass solves, etc.  In practice, the quality of the ionospheric correction is limited by the relatively sparse sampling (in time and direction) of the available TEC information.  Especially active ionospheric conditions may not be corrected very well.  Also, direction-dependent (*within the instantaneous field-of-view*) ionosphere corrections are not yet supported.  Various improvements are under study for future releases.\n",

In this context, it is mechanically valid to use *spwmap* to transfer a **bandpass** solution from a wide, low-resolution spectral window to a narrow, higher-resolution spectral window that falls within the wide one in sky frequency space.   On the other hand, if adequate data for a **bandpass** solution is unavailable for a specific spectral window, e.g., due to contamination by line emission or absorption (such as HI), or because of flagging, **bandpass** solutions from other spectral windows (i.e., at different sky frequencies) can be applied using *spwmap*.   In this case, it is also necessary to add *\\'rel*\\' to the frequency interpolation string in the *interp* parameter, as this will force the interpolation to be calculated in relative frequency units.  Specifically, the center frequency of the **bandpass** solution will be registered with the absolute center frequency of each of the MS spectral windows to which it is applied, thereby enabling relative frequency registration.  The quality of such calibration transfer will depend, of course, on the uniformity of the hardware parameters and properties determining the bandpass shapes in the observing system\\--this is often appropriate over relatively narrow bandwidths in digital observing systems, as long as the setups are sufficiently similar (same sideband, same total spectral window bandwidth, etc., though note that the channelization need not be the same).  Traditionally (e.g., at the VLA, for HI observations), **bandpass** solutions for this kind of calibration transfer have be solved by combining spectral windows on either side of the target spectral window (see the task documentation for [**bandpass**](../api/casatasks.rst) for more information on solving with *combine=\\'spw\\'*).\n",

In **gaincal** it is also possible to select a *refantmode*, either '*flex*' or \\'*strict*\\'.  A list of antennas can be provided to this parameter and, for refantmode=\\'flex\\', if the first antenna is not present in the solutions (e.g., if it is flagged), the next antenna in the list will be used, etc.   See the documentation for the **rerefant** task for more information.  If the selected antenna drops out, the next antenna specified (or the next nearest antenna) will be substituted for ongoing continuity in time (at its current value) until the refant returns, usually at a new value (not zero), which will be kept fixed thenceforth.  You can also run without a reference antenna, but in this case the solutions will formally float with time; in practice, the first antenna will be approximately constant near zero phase. It is usually prudent to select an antenna near the center of the array that is known to be particularly stable, as any gain jumps or wanders in the *refant* will be transferred to the other antenna solutions. Also, it is best to choose a reference antenna that never drops out, if possible.Setting a *preavg* time will let you average data over periods shorter than the solution interval first before solving on longer timescales.  This is necessary only if the visibility data vary systematically within the solution interval in a manner independent of the solve-for factors (which are, by construction, considered constant within the solution interval), e.g., source linear polarization in **polcal**.

It is best to use this in early stages (for example in a first bandpass calibration) so that later stages (such as final gain calibration) can absorb the lost normalization scaling.

This has been CASA\\'s traditional behavior (prior to CASA 5.7), in order to be conservative w.r.t. flags. If instead *corrdepFlags=True* (for CASA 5.7+), correlation-dependent flags will be respected exactly and precisely as set, such that any available unflagged correlations will be used in the solve for calibration factors.  For the tasks currently supporting the *corrdepflags* parameter (*gaincal, bandpass, fringefit*), this means any unflagged parallel-hand correlations will be used in solving, even if one or the other parallel-hand (or either of the cross-hands) is flagged.  Note that the *polcal* task does not support *corrdepflags* since polarization calibration is generally more sensitive to correlation-dependence in the flagging in ways which may be ill-defined for partial flagging; this stricture may be relaxed in future for non-leakage solving modes.  Most notably, this feature permits recovery and calibration of visibilities on baselines to antennas for which one polarization is entirely flagged, either because the antenna did not have that polarization at all (e.g., heterogeneous VLBI, where flagged visibilities are filled for missing correlations on single-polarization antennas), or one polarization was not working properly during the observation. \n",

These instrumental polarization errors are antenna-based and generally assumed constant with time, but the algebra of their effects is more complicated than the simple \\~scalar multiplicative gain calibration.  Also, the net gain calibration renders the data in an arbitrary cross-hand phase frame that must also be calibrated.   The **polcal** task provides support for solving for instrumental polarization (poltype=\\'Df\\' and similar) and cross-hand phase (\\'Xf\\').

Unless the online system has accounted for cross-hand delays (typically intended, but not always achieved), the gain and bandpass calibration will only correct for parallel-hand delay residuals since the two polarizations are referenced independently. Good gain and bandpass calibration will typically leave a single cross-hand delay (and phase) residual from the reference antenna.  Plots of cross-hand phases as a function of frequency for a strongly polarized source (i.e., that dominates the instrumental polarization) will show the cross-hand delay as a phase slope with frequency. This slope will be the same magnitude on all baselines, but with different sign in the two cross-hand correlations.

As a result, e.g., the time-dependent gain calibration will be distorted by any non-zero source polarization, and some degree of iteration will be required to isolate the gain calibration if the source polarization is not initially known. These complications can actually be used to advantage in solving for the instrumental calibration; in can be shown, for example, that a significantly linearly polarized calibrator enables a better instrumental polarization solution than an unpolarized calibrator.\n",

        "The task **wvrgcal** generates a gain table based on Water Vapor Radiometer (WVR) data and is used for ALMA data reduction. Briefly, the task enables a Bayesian approach to calculating the coefficients that convert the outputs of the ALMA 183 GHz water-vapor radiometers (mounted on each antenna) into estimates of path fluctuations which can then be used to correct the observed interferometric visibilities.\n",

        "The CASA task is an interface to the executable wvrgcal, which is part of the CASA 5 distribution and can also be called from outside CASA. The wvrgcal software is based on the libair and libbnmin libraries which were developed by Bojan Nikolic at the University of Cambridge as part of EU FP6 ALMA Enhancement program. CASA 5 contains version 2.1 of wvrgcal. The algorithmic core of wvrgcal is described in three ALMA memos (number 587 [\\[1\\]](#Bibliography), 588  [\\[2\\]](#Bibliography), and 593 [\\[3\\]](#Bibliography) ) which describe the algorithms implemented in the software.\n",

        "The CASA task interface to wvrgcal follows closely the interface of the shell executable at the same time staying within the CASA task parameter conventions. In ALMA data, the WVR measurements belonging to a given observation are contained in the ASDM for that observation. After conversion to an MS using **importasdm**, the WVR information can be found in separate spectral windows. As of April 2016, it is still one single spectral window for all WVRs, however, the ID of the spectral window may vary between datasets. The **wvrgcal** task identifies the SPW autonomously, but it can also be specified via the parameter *wvrspw* (see below). The specified spectral window(s) must be present in the MS for **wvrgcal** to work. This is not to be mixed up with the list of spectral windows for which solutions should be calculated and which can be specified with the parameter *spw*. Note that **wvrgcal** will calculate a correction only for the scans with the words ON_SOURCE, SIGNAL, or REFERENCE in the scan intent. The various features of **wvrgcal** are then controlled by a number of task parameters (see the list above). They have default values which will work for ALMA data. An example for a typical **wvrgcal** call can be found in the ALMA CASA guide for the NGC 3256 analysis:\n",

        "Here, *vis* is the name of input visibility file which as mentioned above also contains the WVR data and *caltable* is the name of the output gain calibration table. WVR data is typically in spectral window 0, but in the example above, the data are contained in spectral window 4. Although **wvrgcal** should automatically identify this SPW, it is explicitly specified with the *wvrspw* parameter in the above example. The *toffset* parameter is the known time offset in seconds between the WVR measurements and the visibility integrations for which they are valid. For ALMA, this offset is presently -1 s (which is also the default value).\n",

        "The parameter *segsource* (segregate source) controls whether separate coefficients are calculated for each source. The default value True is the recommended one for ALMA. When *segsource* is True, the subparameter *tie* is available. It permits the formation of groups of sources for which common coefficients are calculated as well as possible. The *tie* parameter ensures best possible phase transfer between a group of sources. In general it is recommended to tie together all of the sources in a single Science Goal (in ALMA speak) and their phase calibrator(s). The recommended maximum angular distance up to which two sources can be tied is 15 degrees. The parameter statsource controls for which sources statistics are calculated and displayed in the logger. This has no influence on the generated calibration table.\n",
        "\n",
        "Via the parameter *spw*, one can control for which of the input spectral windows **wvrgcal** will calculate phase corrections and store them in the output calibration table. By default, solutions for all spectral windows are written except for the ones containing WVR data. The **wvrgcal** task respects the flags in the Main and ANTENNA table of the MS. The parameter *mingoodfrac* lets the user set a requirement on the minimum fraction of good measurements for accepting the WVR data from an antenna. If antennas are flagged, their WVR solution is interpolated from the three nearest neighboring antennas. This process can be controlled with the new parameters *maxdistm* and *minnumants*. The former sets the maximum distance an antenna used for interpolation may have from the flagged one. And *minnumants* sets how many near antennas there have to be for interpolation to take place. For more details on the WVR Phase correction, see also the the ALMA Memo \"Quality Control of WVR Phase Correction Based on Differences Between WVR Channels\" by B. Nikolic, R. C. Bolton & J. S. Richer [\\[4\\]](#Bibliography) , see also ALMA memo 593 [\\[3\\]](#Bibliography).\n",

        "The **wvrgcal** task writes out a variety of information to the logger, including various statistical measures of the performance. This allows the user to judge whether WVR correction is appropriate for the MS, to check whether any antennas have problematic WVR values, and to examine the predicted performance of the WVR correction when applied. For each set of correction coefficients which are calculated (the number of coefficient sets are controlled by the parameters *nsol*, *segsource* and *tie*), the **wvrgcal** output to the logger first of all shows the time sample, the individual temperatures of each of the four WVR channels, and the elevation of the source in question at that time. For each of these coefficient sets, it then gives the evidence of the bayesian parameter estimation, the calculated precipitable water vapor (PWV) and its error in mm, and the correction coefficients found for each WVR channel (dTdL).\n",
        "\n",
        "The output then shows the statistical information about the observation. First of all it gives the start and end times for the parts of the observation used to calculate these statistics (controlled by *segsource*). It then shows a break down for each of the antennas in the data set. This gives the antenna name and number; whether or not it has a WVR (column WVR); whether or not it has been flagged (column FLAG); the RMS of the path length variation with time towards that antenna (column RMS); and the discrepancy between the RMS path length calculated separately for different WVR channels (column Disc.). These values allow the user to see if an individual WVR appears to have been suffering from problems during the observation, and to flag that antenna using *wvrflag* if necessary. This discrepancy value, Disc., can in addition be used as a simple diagnostic tool to evaluate whether or not the WVR correction caltable created by **wvrgcal** should be applied. In the event of the WVR observations being contaminated by strong cloud emission in the atmosphere, the attempt by **wvrgcal** to fit the water vapor line may not be successful, and applying the produced calibration table can in extreme cases reduce the quality of the data. However, these weather conditions should identified by a high value in the discrepancy column produced when running **wvrgcal**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Discrepancy values of greater than a 1000 microns usually indicate strong cloud contamination of the WVR data, and the output calibration table should probably not be applied. If the values are between 100 and 1000 microns, then the user should manually examine the phases before and after applying the caltable to decide if WVR correction is appropriate. Work is underway at ALMA to provide additional routines to at least partially remove the cloud component from the WVR data before calculating phase corrections. CASA 4.7 will contain a first tested version of such a tool. After the antenna-by-antenna statistics, the output then displays some estimates of the performance of the **wvrgcal** correction. These are the thermal contribution from the water vapor to the path fluctuations per antenna (in microns), the largest path fluctuation found on a baseline (in microns), and the expected error on the path length calculated for each baseline due to the error in the coefficients (in microns).\n",

The switch is performed by setting the parameter *usefieldtab* to True.\n",

        "By default, **wvrgcal** puts solutions for all spectral windows of the MS into the output calibration table. Since usually only the spectral windows are of interest in which the science target and the calibrators were observed, it is not necessary to store solutions for other spectral windows. The spectral windows for which solutions are stored can be selected with the parameter *spw*, e.g. spw = \\[17,19,21,23\\] will make **wvrgcal** write only solutions for spectral windows 17, 19, 21, and 23. With respect to the input WVR spectral windows, **wvrgcal** will by default regard all windows with 4 channels as WVR data. In typical ALMA data there is only one such spectral window in each ASDM. This may change in the future. In any case, the input WVR spectral window(s) can be selected with the optional parameter *wvrspw*. The syntax is the same as for the parameter *spw* above.\n",
