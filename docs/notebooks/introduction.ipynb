        "- The task simalma was updated to produce the expected output. A bug was fixed where the task simalma failed to return properly in due to import dependency problems. In addition, a problem calculating the image size for the default imsize='[]' was fixed, and an extraneous primary beam scaling before combining interferometric and single dish data has also been removed. Please use CASA 6.1.1 (not 6.1.0/5.7.0 or 6.1.2/5.7.2) for running simalma!\n",
        "- In the task flagcmd, the plot style has been modified to prevent apparently missing flags when the resolution of the plot resolution (in pixels) is insufficient. Note that the plots will now tend to represent a higher density of flags than there really is.\n",
        "- Casa and Casa Viewer launcher scripts now pass font file paths to PGPLOT on macOS. This fixed a bug that axes labels did not show up in the CASA Viewer for Mac OSX.\n",

        "\n",
        "- CASA 6.1 is available as both a full installation (the tarball, as has historically been provided) and as modular Python packages, and has been updated from Python 2.7 to Python 3.6. CASA 5.7 is scientifically equivalent and remains Python 2.7 compliant.\n",
        "- A new task sdintimaging is available for joint deconvolution of Single Dish and Interferometer data.- A new task sdtimeaverage is available for averaging single-dish spectral data over specified time.\n",
        "- A new single-dish spectral imaging mode, 'cubesource', is available in the task tsdimaging.\n",
        "- A new parameter corrdepflags has been added to the gaincal, bandpass, and fringefit tasks to permit more control of flagging subsets of correlations.\n",
        "- The fringefit task now includes support for dispersive delays.\n",
        "- The CASA simulator now uses tclean instead of clean.\n",
        "- The ability to correct for heterogeneous antenna pointing offsets stored in the POINTING sub-table of the MS has been added to tclean (gridder='awproject').\n",
        "- statwt now includes weighting each visibility by its exposure time, and also improved in the way the timebin parameter is interpreted when its value is an integer.\n",
        "- the imsmooth task has been made consistency with the rest of CASA in terms of masking\n",
        "- simobserve now reads and populates antenna names rather than assigning numbers, which makes comparing simulated and real data easier.\n",
        "- The fldmap parameter within the cal library will now support multiple fields\n",
        "- CARTA v.1.4 is available for users to visualize CASA data outside the CASA Viewer. CARTA contains a growing amount of functionality available in the Viewer, and includes several features that are superior to the CASA Viewer.\n",
        "- VLA P-band models have been made available in CASA for several standard calibrators.\n",
        "- Ephemeris tables for Solar System objects have been extended in time\n",
        "- An \"execfile\" python shortcut has been added to the (Python 3 based) CASA 6 environment for backwards compatibility with ALMA scriptForPI.py restore scripts.\n",
        "- For continuum imaging (specmode='mfs’), the .workdirectory, where all temporary images produced by the parallel runs were placed, has been removed.\n",
        "- A large number of bugs have been fixed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Full Release Notes\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Import/Export**\n",
        "\n",
        "- In importasdm, the 'remove_ref_undef' parameter has been removed. This parameter was added after CASA 4.3 so that MeasurementSets created by importasdm after CASA 4.3 could be made compatible with CASA 4.3 (and older versions of CASA). This was intended to be used for a limited time to allow for backwards compatibility of MeasurementSets with version of CASA older than CASA 4.3. That temporary parameter has now been removed.\n",
        "- The SUB_TYPE column in the PROCESSOR table of a MeasurementSet is now filled by importasdm using the correlatorName appropriate for that PROCESSOR as found in the ASDM CorrelatorMode table when that PROCESSOR is a correlator. If the processor is not a correlator, or an appropriate row cannot be found in the CorrelatorMode table, the processorSubType is used to fill the SUB_TYPE column (SUB_TYPE is unchanged for non-correlator processors).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Calibration**\n",
        "\n",
        "- The statwt application, which consists of both the task statwt and tool method ms.statwt(), has undergone substantial changes. The algorithm used to compute weights now includes weighting each visibility by its exposure time. There are also significant changes to how the application interprets the timebin parameter if it is an integer. For details, please see the complete statwt documentation\n",
        "- A new parameter corrdepflags has been added to the gaincal, bandpass, and fringefit tasks to permit control of behavior when a subset of correlations is flagged. Previously (and now only by the default: corrdepflags=False), such data was ignored, as if all correlations were flagged. Now, if corrdepflags=True, solutions will be obtained for the unflagged polarization in such cases. This enables recovery of data for antennas which may have only one available polarization (common in VLBI).\n",
        "- VLA P-band models for the frequency range between 230 - 470 MHz have been made available in CASA for several standard calibrators, following Perley & Butler (2017). These models can be used in the setjy task.\n",
        "- The fldmap parameter within the cal library will now support multiple fields specified as a selection string, much as the gainfield works in the conventional calibration apply parameters (previously, only selection of a single field was supported).\n",
        "- The runtime of flagdata is approximately 24-34% shorter than in earlier CASA versions, because the summary mode has been optimized.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Imaging**\n",
        "\n",
        "- A new task sdintimaging for the joint reconstruction of single dish and interferometer data is being released in CASA 6.1/5.7. The sdintimaging task implements the algorithm published in Rau et al, 2019. It is being released as 'experimental' and is currently intended for the exploration of the algorithm's capabilities and to gather feedback for the further refinement of the interface. It supports joint deconvolution for spectral cube as well as multi-term wideband imaging, operates on single pointings as well as joint mosaics, includes corrections for frequency dependent primary beams, and optionally allows the deconvolution of only SD images in both cube and mtmfs modes. Documentation about the algorithm, usage modes that have been verified and validated prior to release, and some example images, can be found here and in the sdintimaging task pages. For a list of known issues with this initial implementation as well as planned future development/tests, please refer to the sdintimaging developer page.\n",
        "- The new CARTA (Cube Analysis and Rendering Tool for Astronomy) visualization software version 1.3, with limited features, is now available for users to try.\n",
        "- CARTA v1.3, with limited features, is now available for users to try. CARTA is an alternative data visualization option for some functionality currently available using the CASA Viewer. CARTA is a new image visualization and analysis tool designed for ALMA, VLA, and SKA pathfinders, developed by ASIAA, IDIA, NRAO and Univ. Alberta. CARTA is eventually expected to replace the CASA Viewer, but the current version 1.3 offers only limited functionality and does not include all the features that the Viewer has. Nevertheless, CARTA v.1.3 may be the preferred tool for users who are worried about proper display of header information or overall performance of the CASA Viewer, or who wish to try remote display options, Stokes wedges, custimized layouts, or visualizing HDF5 image formats with CARTA.\n",
        "- The ability to correct for heterogeneous antenna pointing offsets has been added to tclean (gridder='awproject') and augments the existing ability to apply time-dependent pointing corrections. With a choice of usepointing=True, pointing corrections are applied via vectors that are fetched from the POINTING sub-table in the MS. A new parameter, pointingoffsetsigdev, is used to define bins for grouping antennas and deciding the degree of time variability to consider when computing the phase gradients (for usepointing=True). Demonstrations of this feature on simulated as well as VLASS data are documented in our VLASS Pointing Correction Report. CASA acknowledges the ARDG's role in providing the C++ implementation as an addition to the existing AWProject gridder.\n",
        "- The convolution function used by the wproject gridder in tclean has been adjusted to ensure that it is calculated on a grid which size is a composite number. Dramatic slowdowns incurred by setting specific imsize settings (leading to grids of prime numbers) are now avoided.\n",
        "- For deconvolver=‘MTMFS’, the runtime of the minor cycle has been improved, particularly for large imsize, niter, and number of scales for multi-scale deconvolution.\n",
        "- For continuum imaging with specmode='mfs', the creation of a directory called .workdirectory, where all temporary images produced by the parallel runs were placed, has been removed. Only the final gathered/concatenated continuum images now appear in the main directory.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Analysis**\n",
        "\n",
        "- visstat now handles more gracefully commands where all data are flagged within one of the groups (sub-selections) across the reporting axes.\n",
        "- A change in the imsmooth task has been made for better consistency with the rest of CASA, such that combining an existing pixel mask with an OTF mask results in an output mask that is only True for pixels where both input masks are True. A practical application of this change is an apparent \"bug fix\" for the immoments task when used on cubes with per plane beams; before the fix, it was possible for emission outside of the input mask to end up in the output moment maps.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Single Dish**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Averaging SD spectral data over specified time is now available with the new sdtimeaverage task. Dedicated tasks for the baseline-subtraction and pol-averaging are already supported. This sdtimeaverage task is a further dedicated time-averaging task for more convenience.\n",
        "- A new spectral imaging mode, 'cubesource', is available in the task tsdimaging. The 'cubesource' mode is effective only for moving sources and tracks frequency shift during the observation. With 'cubesource' mode, frequency reference frame of the output image will be REST.\n",
        "- In tsdimaging, generation of psf image is disabled until correct implementation for single dish psf image is implemented. This is because the psf image currently generated by tsdimaging is useless in terms of single dish data reduction. This makes performance of tsdimaging faster than previous CASA 5 versions. Having said that, tsdimaging is still slower than sdimaging so that it might be better to use sdimaging for non-ephemeris imaging if performance matters.\n",
        "\n",
        "**VLBI**\n",
        "\n",
        "- The fringefit task now includes support for dispersive delays (inversely proportional to the square of frequency), which parameters solved for is controlled by the new paramactive keyword. The paramactive parameter takes a Python list of Boolean arguments for the delay, rate, and dispersive components. The default settings preserve the previous behavior of the task, which is also expected to be the most common future use case.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Simulations**\n",
        "\n",
        "- simobserve now reads and populates antenna names rather than assigning numbers, which makes it easier to compare plots of simulated data with those of real data. The population of antennas names is based on the fifth column of antenna configuration files passed via the antennalist parameter. Partial line comments in the header and body of such files are now also supported via the octothorpe (#) character.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Other**\n",
        "\n",
        "- The task accum will be deprecated in the next CASA release, version 5.8/6.2.\n",
        "- An \"execfile\" python shortcut has been added to the (Python 3 based) CASA 6 environment for backwards compatibility with ALMA scriptForPI.py restore scripts. The \"execfile\" command has been tested and found to work in the same way as in (Python 2 based) CASA 5 with the exception that the treatment of global variables has changed in Python 3. For \"execfile\" calls within a script which itself is run via \"execfile\", it is necessary to add globals() as the second argument to those \"execfile\" calls in order for the nested script to know about the global variables of the calling script. For example, within a script 'mainscript.py', calls to another script 'myscript.py' should be written as follows: execfile('myscript.py', globals()).\n",
        "- Solar System objects' positional ephemeris tables have been extended in time (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Titan and various asteroids). In addition, Mars and four asteroids (Ceres, Pallas, Vesta, and Lutetia) have explicit light curves based upon detailed thermo-physical modeling; these light curves have also been extended forward in time. The underlying brightness temperature models of these objects, and their relation to the Bulter-JPL-Horizons 2012 flux scale, have not been altered.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Bug-fixes**\n",
        "\n",
        "- For plotms, a large number of bugs were addressed to improve display options and functionality, and to transition the plotms task from CASA 5 to CASA 6.\n",
        "- A bug was fixed that prevented uvtaper from working with Briggs style weighting (briggs, briggsabs, uniform) and perchanweightdensity=True.\n",
        "- A bug in tclean which incorrectly summed the imaging weights when using uniform weighting in parallel runs has been fixed.\n",
        "- A bug in tclean has been fixed that lead to a seg fault when imaging multiple MSes with inconsistent WEIGHT_SPECTRUM columns (i.e., the column exists in all MSes but in some has no data).\n",
        "- A bug in tclean has been fixed, which triggered a sementation fault when chanchunking with savemodel='virtual' and tclean ended with only 1 minor cycle.\n",
        "- A bug was fixed for imaging of ephemeris objects in tclean, which affected targets for which the field IDs observed are not in time order. This caused a noticeable offset in direction of the source in cases when the source was fast moving.\n",
        "- Several bugs that relate to the use of serial and parallel imaging runs in tclean have been fixed. They include a 'latpole' coordinate mismatch when attempting to use an output image from a parallel continuum run in a subsequent serial step, missing miscinfo image header information information in mtmfs parallel continuum runs, and the inability to use a model image from a parallel run in a subsequent serial predict-model step.\n",
        "- A bug in concat and importfitsidi that affected polarization visibility data in concatenated MSs, such that the cross-hands may previously have been spuriously mis-ordered on some baselines in the concatenated MS, has been fixed. The bug could be triggered when the second MS (in time-order) provided to concat had a different antenna table than the first MS. For more information, please see this CASA Knowledgebase Article. Specifically, ALMA Stokes V and VLA Stokes U, when subject to the condition above, would be affected by this bug.\n",
        "- A bug was fixed in the spwmap parameter, which could previously cause an exception when a spw pointed to by other spws did not point to itself. E.g., if only spw 1 has calibration available in the caltable and is to be used to calibrate spws 0,2,3, spwmap=[1,2,1,1] would fail (even if not selecting spw 1 for processing) since spw 1 points to spw 2 (for which there is no available calibration). Most users would not see this problem, since spws for which calibration is available will generally be calibrated by themselves. This is now fixed, and any permutation of spw specifications should work correctly in spwmap.\n",
        "- A bug has been fixed in gencal, specifically in the generation of the antenna position tables for VLA data (this bug did not affect ALMA data). Previously, if the highest-numbered antenna involved in a given observation required a position correction, it was not being registered correctly.\n",
        "- A segfault in imstat when using the ( - ) operator in region file has been fixed.\n",
        "- A bug was fixed where in certain specific circumstances (calibration absent for antenna id=0), Single Dish calibration tables were previously not being applied.\n",
        "- A bug in fixvis was fixed, whereby fixvis was misbehaving when processing Multi-MSs in parallel. Updates to uvcontsub and cvel were also made to ensure accurate internal copying of MMS directory structures.\n",
        "- A bug in flagdata, which led to occasional reports of progress values over 100%, has been fixed.\n",
        "- A bug was fixed in ImageBeamSet::setBeam() in which, while the beam was being replaced in the _beams Matrix object, _maxBeam was not being recalculated. This led to a problem when, in addition, the beam that was being replaced had been the current maximum beam.\n",
        "- In msmd.scansforfield(), the parameter name changed from intent to field, fixing an existing bug in the naming convention.\n",
        "- In sdimaging and tsdimaging, a bug was fixed that could cause an inaccurate direction conversion when more than one MS is given and these data contain the same antenna with the same antenna ID but with different location, i.e., station or pad where the antenna is placed. See this Knowledgebase Article for details.\n",
        "- In the position switch calibration mode of sdcal, a bug resulting in incorrect calibration tables has been fixed. The previous implementation, based on time gap detection, failed in some cases and OFF_SOURCE sequences were incorrectly combined. OFF_SOURCE data is now averaged over rows grouped by STATE_ID which corresponds to SUBSCAN number in the ASDM.\n",
        "- The wrong brightness unit of the weight image created by sdimaging has been fixed. The unit is now empty (unitless).\n",
        "- The simanalyze task previously corrected output images for the primary beam even when pbcor=False. This has been fixed in CASA 5.7/6.1.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Infrastructure**\n",

The configuration and startup options for CASA 5.7/6.1 are described largely in the following CASAdocs pages: Obtaining and Installing, Configuration, and Running User Scripts.\n",
        "- Startup options removed from CASA 6.1 which are still available in CASA 5.7: --telemetry (removed in favor of --notelemetry in CASA 6), --trace, and --maclogger.

        "- In tclean, a bug was fixed in which the convolution function support size may change for different chunks. This bug appeared when chanchunk > 1 and the fractional bandwidth is large enough for the primary beams to be significantly different between chunks.\n",
        "- A bug in tclean has been fixed which was triggered when a chanchunk is created with only one channel, causing a change in interpolation and discontinuity in sensitivity.\n",
        "- In tclean, a bug that caused errors in the image center for high proper motion ephemeris targets has been fixed.\n",
        "- When running the polfromgain task with the caltable parameter, a bug prevented the removal of the newly created caltable using rmtables(). The new caltable is now cleared from the table cache to avoid this problem.\n",
        "- In gaincal, a user-specified spwmap list that is too long (cf the number of spws in the MS) is now trapped and will result in an error message. Also, delay tables in the multi-band case which are applied using the cal library will now use the correct pivot frequency per spectral window, matching the non-cal library case.\n",

        "\n",
        "- In importasdm, CalAntennaSolutions tables with the new spectralWindowId field required by the VLA can be filled to a table using the asis option. Versions of this table produced by ALMA without that field are still supported.\n",
        "\n",
        "**MS Viewing, Editing, Manipulation**\n",
        "\n",
        "- A new feature was added to plotms to show the atmospheric curve for the image sideband (in black) along with the atmospheric transmission curve or the sky temperature curve. This feature is enabled with a new showimage parameter (True/False, default False), or a checkbox on the Axes tab in the GUI. The image sideband curves can be shown only if (1) showatm or showtsky is also selected, (2) the MS (or the MS associated with a calibration table) is available and has not been split resulting in reindexed spectral window IDs, and (3) this MS has an ASDM_RECEIVER table.  \n",
        "- Pointing plots in plotms have the following enhancements:\n",
        "    - B1950 and GALACTIC reference frames are now supported as xframe and yframe parameters.\n",
        "    - The value 'cubic' in the xinterp and yinterp parameters is no longer allowed and has been replaced with 'cubic spline'.\n",
        "    - Axes labels and values are formatted and sorted in accordance with the reference frame.\n",
        "- The ia.modify() tool now handles ellipses/disks correctly. Further, pixels with centers inside the disk will have the same values, even if a pixel straddles the edge of the disk. Pixels which straddle the edge of the disk which have centers outside the disk are given values of zero. Thus, one should not expect the flux density of the disk to be exactly the provided value to the component list; for a given size disk, the computed flux density will be closer to the expected value for images with smaller pixels.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Calibration**\n",
        "\n",
        "- In task bandpass, relative frequency-dependent interpolation is now supported when applying bandpass tables, e.g., to permit use of offset bandpass calibration (e.g., for HI and similar cases where line features may contaminate an ordinary bandpass calibration scan).\n",
        "- In the experimental fringefit task, a keyword niter has been added to set a maximum number of iterations for the global least squares solver. The default is 100; in cases with high signal-to-noise this limit is not reached.\n",
        "- In the fringefit task, the calibration tables were extended to anticipate the integration of code for correcting dispersive atmospheric delays in an upcoming CASA version. This means that calibration tables created with fringefit in CASA 5.5 cannot be used in CASA 5.6 (see Known Issues for details).\n",
        "- The fluxscale task has been updated so that the output fluxtable is no longer able to overwrite the input caltable. The user can still specifically set append=True to append the current flux-scaled results to the existing table.\n",
        "- The fluxscale task now populates the fitFluxd and fitRefFreq keys in the returned dictionary if an SDM contains only a single spectral window. No fitting is performed, but fitFluxd and fitRefFreq are filled with the values from fluxd and freq, respectively.\n",

        "- The capabilities of clean are now in tclean. The clean task will be deprecated in the near future! Please use tclean instead. All major functionality from clean is present in tclean via a modified interface along with additional algorithmic options.\n",
        "- In tclean, a suite of 30+ functional verification tests have been written to evaluate various imaging modes relating to joint mosaicing and wideband imaging. Data were simulated for the VLA L-band, with one 1 Jy point source with spectral index of -0.5, located in-between two overlapping pointings of a mosaic, and with three channels spanning 1-2 GHz. Tests include single-field as well as two-field (joint mosaic) imaging modes, spectral cube and multi-term wideband imaging, gridders 'mosaic', 'awproject' and 'standard' along with appropriate post-deconvolution pb-correction steps in order to achieve flat-sky fluxes and spectral indices, with all tests operating in serial as well as in parallel modes. Several Known Issues are still in place for widefield and wideband imaging in tclean, so users should continue to use these algorithms at their own discretion.\n",
        "- In tclean, the gridders 'mosaic' and 'awproject' can now make use of the 'usepointing' parameter to use entries supplied in the POINTING subtable of the MS rather than the FIELD table for applying a phase gradient during gridding convolution. This ensures that the image-domain primary beam is formed from antenna voltage patterns centered at the true pointing direction per antenna. Please read the chapter on widefield imaging for details on how both gridders deal with antennas pointed in different directions.\n",
        "- In tclean, the parameter ‘smallscalebias’ has been added to the option deconvolver = ‘mtmfs’ to more efficiently clean signal that shows structure at different spatial scales. See CASA Memo 9 for details.\n",
        "- In tclean, the Multiscale CLEAN algorithm (deconvolver = 'multiscale') has been improved. For a flat spectral model (nterms=1), deconvolver = 'multiscale' and deconvolver = 'mtmfs' now produce deconvolved images that are similar. See CASA Memo 9 for details.\n",
        "- In tclean, the default setting for perchanweightdensity, which enables the calculation of the weight density for each channel in a cube independently, has been changed to True.\n",
        "- Auto-multithresh now functions with polarization data. It applies the same algorithms to the Stokes QUV images as used for the Stokes I image. This means that the full masking process is applied to the positive emission (including the prune and grow steps), but that the masking of the negative emission only includes the initial threshold mask (no prune or grow).\n",

        "\n",
        "**Single Dish**\n",
        "\n",
        "- A new task nrobeamaverage is available. The task is for 'ON-ON' observation datasets from Nobeyama 45m telescope, to average on-source data over different beams.\n",
        "- tsdimaging has new modes of phasecenter to track moving objects. One is phasecenter='TRACKFIELD' to use ephemeris table attached to MS, and the other is to set ephemeris table name explicitly to phasecenter.\n",
        "- In sdcal, the 'otf' calibration mode has improved, as higher order interpolation has been implemented to get pointing direction for each spectral data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Simulations**\n",
        "\n",
        "- The simobserve task is now able to create a multi-channel MeasurementSet from a component list using a new subparameter of the componentlist parameter called comp_nchan.\n",
        "- The ALMA receiver temperatures assumed by the simobserve task have been updated to the values assumed in the Cycle 7 Technical Handbook. The simalma task now also uses these values. Please see the simobserve task page for specific Trx values for each band.\n",

        "\n",
        "- A large number of memory leaks have been addressed in the code.\n",
        "- A bug has been fixed where explicitly setting the restoringbeam parameters (including 'common' beam) in tclean produced a wrong flux scaling of the residuals. See this memo for details.\n",
        "- In plotms, several bugs have been resolved that deal with correct scaling and labeling of the axes.\n",
        "- Running tclean or plotms on a dataset with a mixed polarization setup (some windows exclude cross-hand terms) where only the LL and RR correlations have been split out, is now working correctly.\n",
        "- A bug in specsmooth for the boxcar smoothing option has been fixed, such that the frequency labeling in the header is now correct.\n",
        "- In gaincal, multiband delay solving (gaintype='K', with combine='spw') can now properly handle heterogeneous spws (e.g., spws with different bandwidths, channelizations, etc.).\n",
        "- In importvla, a number of bugs that affected the import of archival VLA data have been addressed.\n",
        "- In tclean, the interpolation (when set to 'linear' and 'cubic') of data prior to gridding was changed to fix a problem that was found when chanchunk >1 or in parallel. The problem was that at the edge of chunks (or parallel cube partition) the psf will exhibit jumps in size. The interpolation alignment with the data channel was changed to fix this issue.\n",
        "- tclean runs now without errors in parallel cube mode when the number of channels is lower than the number of parallel servers.\n",
        "- imregrid can now regrid an image with multiple channels to another cube which overlaps by 1 channel.\n",
        "- A bug in applycal which resulted in single dish caltables being left open when using the cal library has been fixed.\n",
        "- An error caused by leaving table lock on the internal mask when tclean was restarted with savemodel=‘modelcolumn’ has been fixed.\n",

        "- plotms now has the capability to plot antennas pointing directions. Refer to Ant-Ra / Ant-Dec axes, and to the Antenna Pointing Direction Parameters section in plotms documentation. Averaging is currently not supported for these axes. This feature has only been implemented for ALMA, ASTE, and NRO data.\n",

        "    - fringefit now allows specification of multiple reference antennas and automatically chooses an alternative reference antenna if no data for the initial reference antenna is available.\n",
        "    - fringfit now allows specification of search windows for delay and rate.\n",
        "    - fringefit now has the option to skip the globalization step.\n",

        "- rerefant now supports rereferencing solutions produced by the fringefit task.\n",
        "- The task polcal has two new parameters, Xfparang+QU and PosAng. These are considered experimental in CASA 5.5.  \n",
        "    - Xfparang+QU uses parallactic angle coverage on a significantly linearly polarized calibrator to estimate the cross-hand phase spectrum prior to instrumental polarization calibration (for either basis). It solves for the apparent cross-hand phase spectrum (channelized) and integrated (per-spw) fractional linear polarization, Q and U. Xfparang+QU is part of \"standard\" polarization calibration for ALMA (linear feed basis), and is under study as an option for the VLA (circular basis).\n",
        "    - PosAng solves directly for the absolute position angle offset spectrum, for either the linear or circular basis. PosAng is redundant with traditional cross-hand phase spectrum calibration (poltype='Xf') for the circular feed basis (but permits a semantic distinction in heuristics); for the linear basis, an external calibration reference more accurate than the presumed feed registration is required (e.g., a polarized beacon such as ALMA is constructing).\n",
        "- A new task polfromgain is added, which can estimate calibrator linear polarization from gain solutions (which assumed zero linear polarization in the model) in the linear basis. This is part of the \"standard\" ALMA polarization calibration. Task polfromgain is considered experimental in CASA 5.5.\n",
        "- A new task apparentsens is added, which will estimate nominal imaging sensitivity from the visibility weights as a function of data selection and imaging weight parameters. Also reports relative sensitivity compared to pure natural weighting. Supports only continuum (specmode='mfs') imaging at this time.  \n",
        "- A new single-dish task sdpolaverage is added to export data averaged over different polarizations.\n",
        "- In task gaincal, the new parameters solmode and rmsthresh have been added to support robust solving modes: L1 and/or on-the-fly outlier rejection while solving. This feature is experimental in CASA 5.5.\n",

        "- A new visibility weighting option, weighting='briggsabs', is now available in tclean. The advantage of this weighting option is that it is much more aggressive with respect to changes in npixels, the uv-cell size. The Briggsabs option is experimental in CASA 5.5 - please use at own discretion!\n",
        "- A new parameter perchanweightdensity has been implemented in tclean, which when set to perchanweightdensity=True provides a per channel way to calculate Briggs weight density for image cubes. This results in a more uniform sensitivity per channel for cubes, but with generally larger psfs than the default setting of perchanweightdensity=False (prior behavior).\n",
        "- In tclean, the ability is added to do full AW-Projection corrections, using frequency and time dependent primary beams, suitable for VLA widefield and wideband imaging. The use AW-Projection is experimental in CASA 5.5 - please use at own discretion! The corrections are azimuthally asymmetric to account for feed leg structures and sidelobes of the primary beam. They also include beam squint, which is corrected during gridding as a function of time, band, and frequency within a given band. The frequency dependence of the primary beam within the data being imaged is included in the calculations and can optionally also be corrected for during gridding. In addition, w-corrections to account for sky curvature and non-coplanar baselines are now possible. The AW-Projection algorithm is currently undergoing commissioning for the VLA Sky Survey pipeline and is being tested for a variety of other use cases. We aim to officially endorse it for general use in CASA 5.6.\n",
        "- In tclean, a new improved noise calculation was implemented for \"auto-multithresh\" automask and n-sigma threshold stopping. It allows more robust noise estimate in the presence of extended source structures and/or absorption. Set a newly introduced parameter, fastnoise, to False to active the new noise calculation. When the default, fastnoise=True, is chosen a simple median absolute deviation (MAD) based noise calculation will be used as in the previous releases. In addition, the sidelobe threshold is now being correctly chosen over the noise threshold for the cases where the peak residual is negative and both automask and n-sigma threshold stopping are used together.\n",

The official ALMA pipeline release is CASA 5.4.0. The CASA 5.4 releases build on CASA 5.3. Changes compared to the CASA 5.3 release are listed below.

        "A patch to CASA 5.4.1 with the version number CASA 5.4.1-32 is officially released by CASA and approved by the VLA, and can be downloaded from the CASA download page. The 5.4.1-32 version solved a critical bug for large mosaic cubes, where the signal-to-noise in the first pointing of a field could be noticeably lower than in the rest of the cube. This solution is also implemented in subsequent CASA versions (e.g. CASA 5.4.2 and up).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem:** The problem occurred when the chanchunk parameter in tclean is put to a value greater than the default value of 1. Note that for chanchunks = -1 (which is often used as default for ALMA), chanchunks > 1 is triggered whenever the estimated memory requirement is > 80% of the system memory. The value of chanchunks used to create a cube is printed in the casa .log file, shortly after tclean starts. The chanchunk feature is useful for large images cubes, where the gridders can run into memory limits as they loop over all available image planes for each row of data accessed. To prevent this, the chanchunk parameter can be used to grid subsets of channels in sequence, so that at any given time only part of the image cube needs to be loaded into memory. The bug found for values of chanchunk >1 affects primarily mosaic images, where each \"source\" is made up of more than one \"field\", but technically also affects single field observations, where each \"source\" is made up of one \"field\". The specifics of the bug in tclean are:\n",

        "\n",
        "*gridder='standard':* the first integration of each source (i.e. each field in this case) included in the image is dropped (though typically the 'standard' gridder is used when there is only one field).\n",
        "\n",
        "The loss in signal-to-noise in the affected pointing scales with sqrt(#integrations -1)/ #integrations, so gets less problematic when a pointing is visited with a large number of integrations. For example, if a field has > 5 integrations throughout the data selected for the image, the loss in rms noise will be < 10%. So only images with few integrations per field are adversely affected - typically these will be large mosaics and very short snapshot observations.\n",

        "    - ALMA 7m-array mosaics imaged with CASA versions up to and including 4.7.2 (Cycle 0-4): The ALMA 7m-array mosaic imaging used a non-optimal definition for the antenna primary beam in both clean and tclean up to CASA 4.7.2. For Nyquist-sampled mosaics, after primary beam correction, within the 50% mosaic primary beam response, the result is flux densities that are too high by ~10%. At the 20% mosaic primary beam response level, the flux densities are too large by ~30%.\n",

This truncation causes aliasing (at some level) in all CASA mosaic images made with the mosaic gridder. The manifestation of the problem in the image plane depends sensitively on a range of factors including: mosaic shape, mosaic spatial sampling, and uniformity of mosaic sensitivity per pointing. In extreme cases errors as large as 15% have been observed inside the 50% mosaic primary beam response, but the median error for most mosaics is a few percent inside the 50% mosaic primary beam response. In particular for rectangular mosaics, the situation rapidly deteriorates beyond the 50% mosaic primary beam response, with flux density errors as large as 30% seen at the 20-50% primary beam response for mosaics with size-ratio in the actual sky-coverage pattern of 1.5 or larger.\n",

        "The CASA 5.4 release builds on CASA 5.3. Changes compared to the CASA 5.3 release are listed below. The CASA 5.4.0 release includes usage of the ALMA pipeline (the VLA pipeline will be accommodated in a subsequent CASA 5.4.1 release).\n",

        "**IMPORTANT: NEW VERSION CASA 5.4.0-70**\n",
        "\n",
        "A patch to CASA 5.4.0 with the version number CASA 5.4.0-70 is officially released by CASA and approved by ALMA, and can be downloaded from the CASA download page. The 5.4.0-70 version solved a critical bug for large ALMA mosaic cubes, where the signal-to-noise in the first pointing (typically a corner) could be noticeably lower than in the rest of the cube.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem:** The problem occurred when the chanchunk parameter in tclean is put to a value greater than the default value of 1. Note that the ALMA pipeline (and often manual imaging) uses chanchunks = -1, which means that chanchunks > 1 is triggered for any cube whenever the estimated memory requirement is > 80% of the system memory, even if this is not explicitly set by the user. The value of chanchunks used to create a cube is printed in the casa .log file, shortly after tclean starts. The chanchunk feature is useful for large images cubes, where the gridders can run into memory limits as they loop over all available image planes for each row of data accessed. To prevent this, the chanchunk parameter can be used to grid subsets of channels in sequence, so that at any given time only part of the image cube needs to be loaded into memory. The bug found for values of chanchunk >1 affects primarily mosaic images, where each \"source\" is made up of more than one \"field\", but technically also affects single field observations, where each \"source\" is made up of one \"field\". The specifics of the bug in tclean are:\n",
        "\n",
        "*gridder='mosaic':* the first integration of the first field of each source included in the mosaic is dropped.\n",
        "\n",
        "*gridder='standard':* the first integration of each source (i.e. each field in this case) included in the image is dropped (though typically the 'standard' gridder is used when there is only one field).\n",
        "\n",
        "The loss in signal-to-noise in the affected pointing scales with sqrt(#integrations -1)/ #integrations, so gets less problematic when a pointing is visited with a large number of integrations. For example, if a field has > 5 integrations throughout the data selected for the image, the loss in rms noise will be < 10%. So only images with few integrations per field are adversely affected - typically these will be large mosaics and very short snapshot observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution:** We recommend ALMA users to use the CASA 5.4.0-70 version, in particular for large image cube mosaics. ALMA users should be aware that the CASA 5.4.1 versions have not been validated for ALMA users.\n",

Lowering this number can help to improve the processing speed of tclean particularly when it involves a large cube, but may lead to less effective masking of extended emission. The default has been selected to optimize masking of extended emission. Some experimentation may be needed to determine the most effective lower value for your purposes.\n",
        "    - An experimental feature has been added to auto-multithresh algorithm (usemask='auto-multithresh') to mask absorption, which is controlled by the sub-parameter negativethreshold. This value is a signal-to-noise based parameter similar to the noisethreshold and lownoisethreshold parameters in the auto-multithresh algorithm. Currently, the masks produced using this threshold are not independent of the emission threshold-based masks, so use of this parameter may lead to masking of low-lying positive emission near absorption. This feature assumes that the data have been continuum subtracted.\n",
