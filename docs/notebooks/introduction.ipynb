        "\n",
        "- **casashell** now prints out a summary of any python exceptions that happen during startup (previously it would silently exit). Users of the monolithic CASA should not notice any changes. This change is primarily useful to developers building the components locally. *(CASA 6.5.1)*\n",

        "\n",
        "**Import/export and MS structure**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **msmetadata tool:** a new method *corrbit()* was implemented to return the value in SPECTRAL_WINDOW:: SDM_CORR_BIT column for the specified spw(s), or a list representing these values for all spectral windows if spw < 0. *(CASA 6.5.0)*\n",

The documentation for this parameter can be found in the [Synthesis Calibration](synthesis_calibration.ipynb) section of the manual.

        "**Manipulation**\n",

        "- **uvcontsub:** A new task uvcontsub was added for continuum subtraction in the uv-domain. The old task uvcontsub has been deprecated and renamed as **uvcontsub_old**. Task **uvcontsub3** has been removed. Future development of the new uvcontsub task includes combining spectral windows through *combine='spw'*, which is not yet working as in the uvcontsub_old task. *(CASA 6.5.2)*\n",

        "\n",
        "- **deconvolve:** A new task 'deconvolve' has been added to provide stand-alone access to the image-domain deconvolver algorithms available within **tclean**. Options supported in this initial version are *'hogbom'*, *'clark'*, *'clarkstokes'*, *'multiscale'*, with support for single-plane images and spectral cubes. The *'mtmfs'* and *'asp'* algorithms will be enabled in a later release. *(CASA 6.5.2)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **sdimaging:** Performances of task sdimaging have been improved, by caching spectra coordinates computed while creating the normal image and re-using - instead of re-computing - them when creating the weight image. A new parameter *enablecache* has been added to the task, making it possible to turn this new feature on or off. The performances improvement is most noticeable for fast-scan datasets with a few channels. For typical fast-scan solar datasets, re-using cached spectra coordinates is roughly 20 times faster than re-computing them, resulting in a ~25-30% speed-up for the whole sdimaging task. *(CASA 6.5.2)*\n",

        "**Analysis**\n",
        "\n",
        "-  **ImageAnalysis tool:** (1) A new string *mbret* parameter was added to *image.restoringbeam()*. *mbret=\"list\"* is the default, and produces backward compatible behavior. *mbret=\"matrix\"* indicates that the return dictionary should be structured such that 'bmaj', 'bmin', and 'bpa' have numpy arrays as values, making it simple to utilize these values as numpy arrays rather than having to write python code to construct such structures. (2) Completed docs for image.beamarea() were also added. No interface changes. *(CASA 6.5.2)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **imbaseline:** a new task **imbaseline** was added to do image-based baseline subtraction for single-dish data. Task imbaseline does, if necessary, smoothing of the spatial/spectral plane of an input image cube to improve S/N, then subtracts spectral baselines from it. *(CASA 6.5.0)*\n",

        "**Simulations**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **simulator tool:** The Simulator code underlying *sm.settrop()* was improved by enabling the tool to support visibility integration times as short as 0.1 s. The new parameter *simint* (seconds) controls the time granularity of the simulation. Default value for simint is -1 which uses a granularity of 10 s (the same as in previous CASA versions). *(CASA 6.5.2)*\n",

        "\n",
        "- **plotbandpass:** Messages that earlier appeared only in the console, now appear in the logs of casa and the pipeline. *(CASA 6.5.2)* \n",
        "\n",
        "- **plotbandpass:** The *getWeather* function of plotbandpass now uses *np.median* when combining values across multiple weather stations to prevent potential issues with faulty values. *(CASA 6.5.2)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **plotms:** A bug was fixed in plotms that caused a crash when combining antenna iteration, averaging and negation. *(CASA 6.5.2)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **CASA Docs:** Fixed a bug in casadocs infrastructure, where for task and tool parameters with multiple possible types, only the first type was being shown in the parameters list. *(CASA 6.5.2)*\n",

        "- **tclean:** a bug was fixed that prevented an outer UV taper to work in combination with *weighting='natural'*. *(CASA 6.5.1)*\n",

        "- **sdbaseline:** *blmode=‘fit’* will now properly account for mask information and calculate the weight of the baseline-subtracted spectral data. In addition, the description for the *'maskmode'* parameter was updated. *(CASA 6.5.1)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **sdbaseline:** fixed incorrect parameter names output in ascii-text format in case of per-spectrum baseline fitting. *(CASA 6.5.1)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **sdbaseline:** fixed the output in ascii-text and csv formats in case of per-spectrum baseline fitting, so that unnecessary info (non-existent parameter values) is not printed. *(CASA 6.5.1)*\n",
        "\n",

Generally this should not matter as hidden parameters are not used. However, known exceptions exist in **tclean**, **sdintimaging**, **apparentsens**, **setjy**, **listvis**, **sdcal**, and **sdfit** where the value of hidden selection parameters does in fact matter.

All such variations cause the PSFs to be position-dependent and could relate to potential instabilities during deconvolution, either requiring many major cycles to converge or diverging.  For spectral-cube imaging, the effects are lower because PSFs are normalized to peak 1 no matter what their raw peak values are. For multi-term imaging, the ratios between the spectral PSF central values matter and the effect/error is enhanved.

        "-    When imaging mosaics with a large number of fields and many MSs in **tclean**, an error can occur that specifies *too many open files*. This can happen for both manual and pipeline imaging when using the *mosweight=True* parameter. The reason is that in CASA 5.5, a trade-off was made to reduce memory demands in tclean when using mosweight, by placing the weights on disk using multiple files. Unfortunately, this memory fix may cause open file problems for data sets consisting of many MSs and fields. The problem has been characterized based on the number of MSs and fields: with respect to earlier CASA releases, the imager code now uses *#MSs x #fields x 2* additional files. In CASA 6.2 and 6.3, the number of open files required for the default *perchanweightdensity=True* case has been dramatically reduced, though *perchanweightdensity=False* imaging runs are more limited. While the CASA team is working on a permanent solution for future CASA versions, the recommended work-around solution is to manually increase the limit for the number of open files, e.g.: *ulimit -Sn 8000* or *ulimit -Sn 16000*. In some cases, increasing the hard-limit on number of open files may be necessary, which requires admin/root permissions. As a rule of thumb, each MS requires ~54 simultaneously open files. With a 16k limit and a maximum of 150 fields per MS, for a use case with *perchanweightdensity=False*, *mosweight=True* tclean will encounter too many open files with ~46 MSs or more, while with *perchanweightdensity=True*, *mosweight=True* tclean will encounter too many open files with ~300 MSs or more. \n",

        "-    The use of the *\"centerbox*\" parameter when specifying a region in **imstat** has a known issue that under very specific circumstances, less pixels are taken into account for the statistics than what is expected. This only occurs when all of the following are true: (1) values are specified in pixels; (2) the width of the box is an even number of pixels (e.g, 4pix, 16pix, or 100pix); and (3) the box is located away from the image center in Right Ascension (progressively more pixels are dropped when moving away from the image center, but only in RA). The issue is a combination of machine rounding errors (when the boundary of the centerbox is exactly at the center of a pixel), and the fact that centerbox has to converts pixel coordinates to sky coordinates to allow all possible combinations of regions. Note that the \"*box*\" parameter is not affected by this, because it can be more strict in only using flat pixel coordinates.    As a simple work-around solution, we recommend to always give the width of the centerbox in \"odd\" number of pixels. Please note that because centerbox places the center of a box in the middle of a pixel and CASA only includes full pixels, the width of a centerbox always has an odd number of pixels anyway. For example, `centerbox=[[1000pix,4000pix],[4pix,4pix]]` for an 8000x8000 pixel image should give npts=25, but due to the above issue will result in `npts <25`.
