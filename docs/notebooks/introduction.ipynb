        "\n",
        "- **pip-wheels:** Pip-wheel for Python 3.10 (in addition to Python 3.8) are now available for modular installation. This can be used to run CASA pip wheels in Google Colab. The all-inclusive monolithic CASA version runs on Python 3.8. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Installation test script:** a test script was added to the CASA packages for users to test their CASA installation. Test datasets will be downloaded on-the-fly. Users will need to pip install casatestutils prior to running the new tests if installing modular CASA. More information can be found on the CASA Docs [Installation](introduction.ipynb#Installation-Tests) pages. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",

        "\n",
        "**Import/export and MS structure**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **multiple MSs input:** clarifications have been added to the *CASA logger* on how the various CASA tasks handle the input of multiple MSs (**concat**, **tclean**, **(t)sdimaging**, **sdintimaging**). This is work in progress, and additional documentation will be provided in a next CASA release. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",

        "\n",
        "**Information**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Telemetry/crash reporter:** the *telemetry* and *crash reporter* functionality was deprecated and removed from the code. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",

        "**Imaging**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **deconvolve:** enabled *mtmfs* as an algorithm option in the deconvolve task. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **sdintimaging:** the default for the sub-parameter *dishdia* was previously 100.0 and it is now set to empty. The task **sdintimaging** will fail if *dishdia* is not set to different than None. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **tclean/deconvolve:** return dictionaries were added for *niter=0* calls, which contain information about peak residual (over the whole image) and total flux from the model image. Deconvolution masks are currently not made or used in the *niter=0* call. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **image tool:** a *fitsheader* member function was added to the *image* tool. This function returns the FITS header for the image represented as a Python dictionary. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- **tsdimaging:** performance was improved about 10% (level of improvement depends on data size). *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",

        "\n",
        "- **tclean:** a bug was fixed where the *mtmfs* deconvolver incorrectly reported the peak residual value at the end of the minor cycle of tclean. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **tclean:** a bug was fixed with *mtmfs* deconvolver in tclean, where imaging with multiple Stokes planes would not correctly write the restoring beam information into the image header. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **tclean:** an edge case was fixed where tclean would crash when attempting to make a cube when provided multiple MSs with different SPW configurations (number, channelization). This was only triggered by very specific configurations of input data. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **plotms:** Fixed a bug in plotms, where antenna selection with iteration did not show all the selected baselines. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **plotms:** a bug was fixed where the point size was ignored when using a *coloraxis*. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **plotbandpass:** a bug was fixed in a logic to group data on the *time* axis. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",
