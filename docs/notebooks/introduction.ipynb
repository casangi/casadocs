        "###Full Release Notes\n",
        "\n",
        "**CASA 6 transition**\n",
        "\n",
        "- The following missing tasks were added to CASA 6: **apparentsens**, **msuvbin**, **imview**, **testconcat**, **uvcontsub3**.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Flagdata:** The interactive *flagdata* GUI is now available in CASA 6\n",
        "\n",
        "**Installation and operation**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Error handling:** All CASA tasks now follow a consistent error handling approach. In CASA 6, when imported from casatasks, all tasks will raise exceptions in case of a severe errror. New [documentation pages](usingcasa.ipynb#Error-Handling-with-CASA-tasks) have been added to explain how errors and exceptions work in CASA tasks, for CASA 5 and CASA 6.\n",
        "\n",
        "**MS viewing, editing, manipulation**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Plotms:** *plotms* has added the following features:\n",
        "  - support was added for M Mueller and Fringe Jones calibration tables.  The new axes \"Delay Rate\" (or \"rate\") and \"Disp Delay\" (or \"disp\", for dispersive delay), along with the existing \"Delay\" axis, are available for Fringe Jones tables.\n",
        "  - Support for BPOLY tables has been refactored and tested.\n",
        "  - support for all averaging types for calibration tables except BPOLY and GSPLINE tables. Averaging may not be combined with channel selection but is supported with all other selection including spw.\n",
        "  - channel selection has been implemented for all types of calibration tables.\n",
        "  - Antenna selection was fixed for the three types of calibration tables: baseline-based (selects on ANT1 and ANT2 as described in MSSelection), reference antenna-based (selects on ANT1 unless '&' syntax is used for the refant), and pure antenna-based (selects on ANT1 only).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **mstransform:** In CASA 5.8/6.2, a bug in *mstransform* has been fixed such that the SIGMA and WEIGHT columns (and their _SPECTRUM variants) are correctly calculated for datacolumn settings other than \"CORRECTED\" and when time averaging is not selected. Previously, only these two cases (datacolumn=\"CORRECTED\" and/or when time averaging was being used) resulted in correct settings for the SIGMA and WEIGHT columns. Further work remains to address some remaining inconsistencies in these columns, as described in the Known Issues list.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **ms tool:** the *ms* tool has been fixed such that when channel averaging has been enabled (via *ms.selectchannel*), the *WEIGHT* column will now have the correct array size. If you have existing code where the *WEIGHT* column was retrieved in a separate call to *ms.getdata* from other columns to avoid this bug, then these calls should now be consolidated into a single call (i.e., with all columns) because the ordering of the rows returned by separate calls is no longer guaranteed to be the same. Also, the *avgtime* option of *ms.getdata* will now correctly retrieve all qualifying rows, regardless of the time sorting of the measurement set.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **listobs:** Task *listobs* has been extended to return MeasurementSet metadata in a dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Calibration**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **accor:** The *accor* task now supports the corrdepflags parameter. This makes it possible to use *accor* on (parts of) data-sets where one polarizations is flagged.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Calibration models (Mars):** The model for Mars from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2030 was corrected. Users of earlier versions that 6.2 should update their [local data repository](external-data.ipynb) manually. (This correction of the Mars model was included also in CASA 6.1.1, but not CASA 6.1.0 or 6.1.2.)\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Gain curves:** The GAIN_CURVE subtable, when present in the MS, is now available to the *gencal* task with *caltype='gc'* and creates an appropriate gain curve calibration table from the information provided in the GAIN_CURVE table.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **setjy:** A correction to the log message has been made in task *setjy* when *standard='Butler-JPL-Horizons 2012'* and *listmodels=True*; the correction reflects the correct starting date for the availability of the time dependent asteroid models (2014.01.01).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **interpolation schemes:** The *lanczos* interpolation method was removed from *imdev/ia.deviation()*.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **TEC map:** The *tec_maps* script for ionospheric \"Total Electron Content\" calibration has been ported to CASA 6 (python3). To follow new server conventions at NASA's Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS), the TEC data retrieval mechanism within the *tec_maps* script has been updated (the out-dated version should have been inoperable since 2020 Nov 1 due to security-related changes in the NASA CDDIS server). The tec_maps.py script has been removed from the CASAaddons repository in favor of a better-maintained version which exists within casatasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Imaging**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **tclean:** A new imaging weighting option, *‘briggsbwtaper’*, has been added to *tclean* which modifies the per-channel cube  imaging weights (i.e., when *perchanweightdensity = True*) to have a similar density to that of the continuum imaging weights, improving alignment between cube and mfs beams for a given dataset. This is currently an experimental weighting scheme, but has been verified for ALMA use-cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **tclean:** Briggs style weighting with *perchanweight=True* no longer creates many temporary files, but only one. Previously, when doing Briggs style weighting, a temporary file was created to keep the weight density grid that is used in calculating the imaging weight. That temporary file has 1 grid when *perchanweight=False*, but it contained *nchan* grids when *perchanweight=True*. When *mosweight=True*, then a temporary file was kept for each field in the mosaic and also for each MS, so a mosaic with a large number of pointing could create hundreds of temporary files. In CASA 6.2, when *perchanweight=True*, only one temporary file is made which contains the imaging weights for every rows and channels of the MSs used.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **tclean:** The *chanchunks* parameter has been removed following a cube imaging refactor of the tclean code in 5.8/6.2 which rendered the parameter unnecessary. Please see the updated tclean documentation describing current [parallel processing for imaging](synthesis_imaging.ipynb#Imager-Parallelization) for more information.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **tclean:** The algorithm that fits a Gaussian to the PSF in *tclean* has been improved for cases where the number of pixels across the main PSF lobe are less than 5 and larger than 10. The fit Gaussian beam size is now stable as a function of the number of pixels in these regimes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **tclean:** The normalization factor used to calculate the imaging weights for *tclean*(..., *perchanweightdensity=True*, *weighting=’briggs’*, …) has been updated to conform to the definition used in *perchanweightdensity=False* (which is derived from [Briggs D., 1995](http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/dissertations/dbriggs/) \\([pdf version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q0kCOlRJwXV2aww_Dr9GnGFsq9dCWjMX/view?usp=sharing)\\). This will cause the beams to be smaller in the region of robust = -1 to 1.5, however the beam achieved at robust = -2 (uniform) and robust = 2 (natural) should not change significantly. The same set of beam sizes previously achievable are still available, albeit at different robust values. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Single Dish**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **sdatmcor:** A new task *sdatmcor* for the atmospheric correction of single dish data is released in CASA 5.8/6.2. The *sdatmcor* task mitigates the residual atmospheric lines due to the elevation difference between the target and reference positions, utilizing the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves (ATM) library in CASA.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **sdbaseline:** Task *sdbaseline* has new parameters *'updateweight'* and *'sigmavalue'*. When *updateweight* is *True*, weight of each baseline-subtracted spectrum is calculated based on its standard deviation or rms and stored in the *WEIGHT* column of the output MS.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **tsdimaging:** Task *tsdimaging* does no longer creates a *.subwt* image.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **atmostphere tool:** Performance of *atmosphere* tool has been improved. After the improvement, atmospheric model calculation using *atmosphere* tool is twice as fast as the previous versions of CASA. Performance of the **tsdimaging** task was also slightly improved.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Simulations**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **simalma:** The task *simalma* was updated to produce the expected output. A bug was fixed where the task simalma failed to return properly in due to import dependency problems. In addition, a problem calculating the image size for the default *imsize='[]'* was fixed, and an extraneous primary beam scaling before combining interferometric and single dish data has also been removed. These fixes were also included in CASA 6.1.1, but not in CASA 6.1.0 and 6.1.2.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Bug fixes**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **mstransform:** A bug in *mstransform* has been fixed such that the SIGMA and WEIGHT columns (and their _SPECTRUM variants) are correctly calculated for datacolumn settings other than \"CORRECTED\" and when time averaging is not selected. Previously, only these two cases (datacolumn=\"CORRECTED\" and/or when time averaging was being used) resulted in correct settings for the SIGMA and WEIGHT columns. Further work remains to address some remaining inconsistencies in these columns, as described in the [Known Issues](introduction.ipynb#Known-Issues).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **tclean:** A bug in the way that the *awproject* gridder in *tclean* calls the data repository in CASA 6 has been fixed. Previously tclean was looking at .casa/config.py for the location of the distro data, but only considering the root data directory existence and not checking existence of the data (more specifically, antenna response data) actually used by it. These have now been fixed to look at the correct casadata distro location, which varies depending on whether it is CASA 5 or 6 and is a tarball or built from source.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **tclean:** A minor bug in how the imaging weights are calculated for *tclean(..., perchanweightdensity=True, weighting=’briggs’, …)* has been fixed. This bug causes a faint vertical sidelobe structure in the PSF when the uv plane is poorly sampled. It did not have a significant impact on most images, and had a marginal ($<$3%) impact on high dynamic range (SNR >300) imaging cases tested for ALMA.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Data respository:** A bug in the way that *tclean* calls the data repository in CASA 6 has been fixed. Previously tclean was looking at .casa/config.py for the location of the distro data but only considering the root data directory existence and not checking existence of the data (more specifically, antenna response data) actually used by it. These have now been fixed to look at the correct casadata distro location, which varies depending on whether it is CASA 5 or 6 and is a tarball or built from source.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **imdev:** The *imdev* interpolation parameter was not being recognized and linear interpolation was being used no matter what its value. That bug has been fixed and now imdev correctly performs the specified interpolation algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **initweights:** A bug in the **initweights** task which was causing it to fail in mpicasa has been fixed (this fix was implemented in the non-public CASA 6.1.3 release version).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **applycal:** A bug was fixed where **applycal** imported from the casatasks module in CASA 6.1 gave the wrong default for the *calwt* parameter, namely *calwt=False* instead of the intended *calwt=True*.\n",
        "\n",
        "- An error was corrected in the [Cal Library Syntax](cal_library_syntax.ipynb) documentation, to the effect that *calwt* settings are controlled by the first entry (per caltable, in multi-entry per caltable cases), and NOT that if any entry specifies *calwt=True*, all entries will use *True*. Nevertheless, if users wish to specify *calwt* explicitly in their scripts.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A bug was fixed that has the default value for *imsize* missing in **tclean** and **apparentsens** in CASA 6.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A bug was solved for imaging ephemeris objects in **tclean**, for which tracking solar system objects was failing when imaging continuum in parallel. Parallel continuum imaging is partitioned over time, and each process was using a different initial time reference. The bug was resolved by forcing all of the processes to use the epoch recorded in the image as the reference.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **importfitsidi:** A bug in **importfitsidi** that affected polarization visibility data, such that the cross-hands may previously have been spuriously mis-ordered on some baselines, has been fixed. This issue has been seen in e-MERLIN data; EVN and VLBA data are unaffected.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A bug in the nsigma parameter in **tclean** has been fixed; values expressed as integers are now being recognized.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **feather:** In previous versions of CASA, the **feather** task was incompatible with input images that were created in parallel. This bug has been fixed by the cube refactor in CASA 5.8/6.2.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A bug in **sdbaseline** was fixed, in which rerun failed if *ms_blparam.txt* file exists. With the fix, *ms_blparam.txt* will be overwritten if it exists.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A bug was fixed where terminal control, such as the use of keyboard arrows, did not work in CASA 6.1.\n",

        "    -   In **tclean**, the gridders *'mosaic'* and *'awproject'* include aperture illumination functions in the gridding convolution functions used for the PSF generation.  Although this strictly follows the math, it has several undesirable features especially in the situation where data are not uniform across all axes across which they are being combined (i.e. if the mosaic pattern is not relatively flat, if the center of the image has no mosaic pointing, if different pointings have drastically different uv-coverages or frequency coverages). All such variations cause the PSFs to be position-dependent and could relate to potential instabilities during deconvolution, either requiring many major cycles to converge or diverging.  For spectral-cube imaging, the effects are lower because PSFs are normalized to peak 1 no matter what their raw peak values are. For multi-term imaging, the ratios between the spectral PSF central values matter and the effect/error is enhanved. When all these uv-coverage variations are avoided (in careful simulations), both algorithms perform as expected for joint wideband mosaics (both with *conjbeams=True* or *False*). For CASA 5.7/6.1, the guidelines are:    -   Full-field, single pointing imaging (spectral cube as well as multi-term) will be accurate as long as the image phase center matches the PB pointing center.  \n",
        "    -   For multi-term wideband joint mosaics, we recommend the use of *gridder=\\'awproject\\'* with *conjbeams=True* as that is the only combination that has demonstrated accurate wideband pb-correction (at *niter=0*) especially in the presence of position-dependent uv-coverage. All other options will need monitoring and several major cycles to ensure convergence.  The image should ideally be centered on a PB center.\n",
        "    -   For spectral cube joint mosaics, both gridders are usable. The effects of PSF position dependence are limited to shape differences (i.e. the peak values and fluxes will still be correct).

        "    - When imaging mosaics with a large number of fields and many MSs in **tclean**, an error can occur that specifies *too many open files*. This can happen for both manual and pipeline imaging when using the *mosweight=True* parameter. The reason is that in CASA 5.5, a trade-off was made to reduce memory demands in tclean when using mosweight, by placing the weights on disk using multiple files. Unfortunately, this memory fix may cause open file problems for data sets consisting of many MSs and fields. The problem has been characterized based on the number of MSs and fields: with respect to earlier CASA releases, the imager code now uses *#MSs x #fields x 2* additional files. In CASA 5.8/6.2, the number of open files required for the default *perchanweightdensity=True* case has been dramatically reduced, though *perchanweightdensity=False* imaging runs are more limited. While the CASA team is working on a permanent solution for future CASA versions, the recommended work-around solution is to manually increase the limit for the number of open files, e.g.: *ulimit -Sn 8000* or *ulimit -Sn 16000*. In some cases, increasing the hard-limit on number of open files may be necessary, which requires admin/root permissions. As a rule of thumb, each MS requires ~54 simultaneously open files. With a 16k limit and a maximum of 150 fields per MS, for a use case with *perchanweightdensity=False*, *mosweight=True* tclean will encounter too many open files with ~46 MSs or more, while with *perchanweightdensity=True*, *mosweight=True* tclean will encounter too many open files with ~300 MSs or more. \n",

        "    -   The use of the *\"centerbox*\" parameter when specifying a region in **imstat** has a known issue that under very specific circumstances, less pixels are taken into account for the statistics than what is expected. This only occurs when all of the following are true: (1) values are specified in pixels; (2) the width of the box is an even number of pixels (e.g, 4pix, 16pix, or 100pix); and (3) the box is located away from the image center in Right Ascension (progressively more pixels are dropped when moving away from the image center, but only in RA). The issue is a combination of machine rounding errors (when the boundary of the centerbox is exactly at the center of a pixel), and the fact that centerbox has to converts pixel coordinates to sky coordinates to allow all possible combinations of regions. Note that the \"*box*\" parameter is not affected by this, because it can be more strict in only using flat pixel coordinates.    As a simple work-around solution, we recommend to always give the width of the centerbox in \"odd\" number of pixels. Please note that because centerbox places the center of a box in the middle of a pixel and CASA only includes full pixels, the width of a centerbox always has an odd number of pixels anyway. For example, `centerbox=[[1000pix,4000pix],[4pix,4pix]]` for an 8000x8000 pixel image should give npts=25, but due to the above issue will result in `npts <25`.
