        "- **xmlcasa:** infrastructure was added to allow for generic template expansion based on values collected from task XML specifications. *(CASA 6.6.5)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **casaconfig:** Monolithic CASA distributions no longer include the required external data, and modular packages (e.g. casatools, casatasks) no longer obtain this data from the casadata python package. Instead, a new casaconfig package is provided to handle configuration settings and to retrieve and update the external data. Most users upgrading their own CASA installation will need to perform a one-time setup of casaconfig before starting CASA. More information is available in the [External Data](external-data.ipynb) Section. *(CASA 6.6.4)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **ASDM:** ASDM code has been synced with master copy generated by ALMA builds. This change includes toggling the default output format to binary (from XML) for the following Cal\\* tables: *CalAmpli, CalAppPhase, CalBandpass, CalCurve, CalData, CalDelay, CalFlux, CalFocusModel, CalFocus, CalGain, CalHolography, CalPointingModel, CalPointing, CalPosition, CalPrimaryBeam, CalReduction, CalSeeing*. This change also includes fixing a bug in how *EntityRef* and *Complex* types were read from tables stored in binary format. *(CASA 6.6.4)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **pip-wheels:**\n",
        "  - Pip-wheel for Python 3.10 (in addition to Python 3.8) are now available for modular installation. This can be used to run CASA pip wheels in Google Colab. The all-inclusive monolithic CASA version runs on Python 3.8. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",
        "  - Incompatibility issues with *matplotlib* for the Python 3.10 wheels in CASA 6.6.0 were resolved in CASA 6.6.3. *(CASA 6.6.3)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Installation test script:** a test script was added to the CASA packages for users to test their CASA installation. Test datasets will be downloaded on-the-fly. Users will need to pip install casatestutils prior to running the new tests if installing modular CASA. More information can be found on the CASA Docs [Installation](introduction.ipynb#Installation-Tests) pages. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",

        "\n",
        "**Import/export and MS structure**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **multiple MSs input:** clarifications have been added to the *CASA logger* on how the various CASA tasks handle the input of multiple MSs (**concat**, **tclean**, **(t)sdimaging**, **sdintimaging**). This is work in progress, and additional documentation will be provided in a next CASA release. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",

        "**Information**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **getantposalma:** new task to query the ALMA antenna position web service and return a list of antennas with their *ITRF* positions. Warning: the web service itself has not yet been fully validated. *(CASA 6.6.4)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Command-line exceptions:** To allow for better testing and trapping of errors, CASA tasks now raise exceptions at the CASA command line instead of returning {{True}} on success and {{False}} on failure.  *(CASA 6.6.3)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Telemetry/crash reporter:** the *telemetry* and *crash reporter* functionality was deprecated and removed from the code. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",

        "\n",
        "- **gencal:** a new *caltype='eop'* parameter was introduced that creates a calibration table for making EOP (Earth Orientation Parameter) corrections. Updated EOPs can be provided through external files in IERS or USNO format or can be taken directly from the casadata repository. *(CASA 6.6.5)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **gencal:** added a new option *'swpwts'* for the *caltype* parameter for use with EVLA data. This acts like the *'swpow'* mode but without including the temperature conversion factors. *(CASA 6.6.5)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **polfromgain:** task polfromgain now permits specifying a minimum parallactic coverage threshold in the a new parameter: *minpacov* (default = 30 deg). This enables avoiding pathological cases of antennas with insufficient parallactic angle coverage which can yield spurious source polarization solutions or cause an exception to the thrown. *(CASA 6.6.4)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **getephemtable:** a new task getephemtable was added to retrieve JPL-Horizons ephemeris data. *(CASA 6.6.3)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **getephemtable:** the *'posrefsys'* keyword of the output table was changed to *'ICRS'*, and support was added for source names containing non-alphanumeric characters. *(CASA 6.6.4)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **getcalmodvla:** a new task getcalmodvla has been added to retrieve flux calibrator brightness distributions from a web service operated by the VLA, and create component lists which may then be used by tasks such as **setjy** to predict model visibilities. *(CASA 6.6.3)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **gencal:** the parameter *ant_pos_time_limit* was introduced for gencal when used in the mode *caltype='antpos'*. When specified (units are days), this parameter will limit the time following the observation for which antenna position corrections are included. This prevents antenna position corrections from being included that may have been determined many months to years after the observation was completed and do not reflect the actual antenna position at the time of observation. This can occur for antennas on certain pads that are not typically moved during configuration changes (generally pads E08, N08, and W08). If the parameter is not specified, the default behavior will include all position corrections that are in the database. *(CASA 6.6.3)*\n",

        "\n",
        "- **setjy:** the *usescratch* parameter now defaults to *True*, and *usescratch=False* is no longer allowed to be used with the *Butler-JPL-Horizons* standard. *(CASA 6.6.4)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **fixplanets:** Functionality to attach JPL-Horizons ephemeris data in *MIME* format to an MS was removed from fixplanets as the underlying conversion function was no longer maintained. Task **getephemtable** can be used to query the JPL-Horizons web service and output the ephemeris table in CASA table format, which can be attached to an MS via fixplanets. *(CASA 6.6.4)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **defintent:** a new task defintent was added to modify the scan intents of a measurement set. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Imaging**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **tclean:** a new parameter *specmode='mvc'* was added, which provides an alternative to *specmode='mfs'* when using the *mtmfs* deconvolver. This new mode combines cube major cycles with continuum minor cycles along with accurate wideband primary beam correction. It calculates the Taylor coefficient images from a coarse cube after doing a frequency-dependent primary beam correction. If using this new mode, one no longer needs to correct for the primary beam's spectral index using the **widebandpbcor** task or the *conjbeams* parameter. This new mode is currently under active development with additional enhancements expected in a future release. *(CASA 6.6.4)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **tclean:** new imaging mode (*specmode='mvc'*) to combine cube major cycles with continuum minor cycles along with accurate wideband primary beam correction.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- **tclean/sdintimaging:** tasks sdimaging and tsdimaging were improved so that:\n",
        "  - they internally sort input list of MSes in chronological order. Input MS lists are now sorted by time to provide improved consistency with the results from task_concat. *CASA (6.6.3)*\n",
        "  - they check for mismatches in column states when given multiple input MSs, e.g. inconsistencies in optional columns such as WEIGHT_SPECTRUM. *CASA (6.6.3)*\n",
        "  - a crash was fixed that could sometimes occur when given a list of measurement sets if there were inconsistencies in the data columns (e.g., WEIGHT_SPECTRUM). *CASA (6.6.3)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **tclean:** algorithmic improvements were implemented to the *ASP deconvolver* when presented with a large spread of spatial scales. *CASA (6.6.3)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **deconvolve:** enabled *mtmfs* as an algorithm option in the deconvolve task. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **sdintimaging:** the default for the sub-parameter *dishdia* was previously 100.0 and it is now set to empty. The task **sdintimaging** will fail if *dishdia* is not set to different than None. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **tclean/deconvolve:** return dictionaries were added for *niter=0* calls, which contain information about peak residual (over the whole image) and total flux from the model image. Deconvolution masks are currently not made or used in the *niter=0* call. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **image tool:** a *fitsheader* member function was added to the *image* tool. This function returns the FITS header for the image represented as a Python dictionary. *(CASA 6.6.0)*\n",

        "**Visualization**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **casaviewer:** the CASA Viewer has been removed from MacOS packages; new exceptions have been added to imview, msview and interactive modes of tclean, deconvolve and sdintimaging; the deprecated viewer task is now removed. See the [Viewer End-of-Life page](../notebooks/viewer_end_of_life.ipynb) for more information. *(CASA 6.6.5)*\n",

        "- **plotms:** callibration table interface added in parameters and GUI. *(CASA 6.6.5)*\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- **sdimaging/tsdimaging:** added new parameter *'interpolation'* to sdimaging and tsdimaging to specify the spectral interpolation rules to use when binning data channels onto image channels and evaluating visibility values at the centers of image channels. The options of this parameter are *'linear'* (default), *'nearest'*, and *'cubic'*. In the prior releases, the interpolation method was fixed as *'nearest'*, but when there were significant differences in the observation dates of the input MSs, *'nearest'* might cause some problems with frequency channel matching. To obtain the same result as the prior, please set *interplation='nearest'*. *(CASA 6.6.5)*\n",

        "\n",
        "- **tclean:** a bug was fixed in tclean that affected imaging with specific combination of solar system (ephemeris) sources, multi-MS, and cube imaging with Briggs' style weighting. The bug was affecting only the first chunk of the cube where tclean would effectively ignore data from the second MS onwards during gridding with that particular combination of circumstances. *(CASA 6.6.5)*\n",
        "\n",
        "- **sdatmcor:** a bug was fixed to mitigate an amplitude drop at edge channels due to convolution. *(CASA 6.6.5)*\n",

This memo documents an approach for efficient and scalable parallelization of large cubes, as a potential near-term option for users who require (or could benefit from) such solutions until next-generation performant solutions are formally made available through observatory operations.

Generally this should not matter as hidden parameters are not used. However, known exceptions exist in **tclean**, **sdintimaging**, **apparentsens**, **setjy**, **listvis**, **sdcal**, and **sdfit** where the value of hidden selection parameters does in fact matter. We are currently investigating the extent of this problem. As a workaround, users can call *default* to manually reset all their parameters.\n",

All such variations cause the PSFs to be position-dependent and could relate to potential instabilities during deconvolution, either requiring many major cycles to converge or diverging.  For spectral-cube imaging, the effects are lower because PSFs are normalized to peak 1 no matter what their raw peak values are. For multi-term imaging, the ratios between the spectral PSF central values matter and the effect/error is enhanved.

        "-    When imaging mosaics with a large number of fields and many MSs in **tclean**, an error can occur that specifies *too many open files*. This can happen for both manual and pipeline imaging when using the *mosweight=True* parameter. The reason is that in CASA 5.5, a trade-off was made to reduce memory demands in tclean when using mosweight, by placing the weights on disk using multiple files. Unfortunately, this memory fix may cause open file problems for data sets consisting of many MSs and fields. The problem has been characterized based on the number of MSs and fields: with respect to earlier CASA releases, the imager code now uses *#MSs x #fields x 2* additional files. In CASA 6.2 and 6.3, the number of open files required for the default *perchanweightdensity=True* case has been dramatically reduced, though *perchanweightdensity=False* imaging runs are more limited. While the CASA team is working on a permanent solution for future CASA versions, the recommended work-around solution is to manually increase the limit for the number of open files, e.g.: *ulimit -Sn 8000* or *ulimit -Sn 16000*. In some cases, increasing the hard-limit on number of open files may be necessary, which requires admin/root permissions. As a rule of thumb, each MS requires ~54 simultaneously open files. With a 16k limit and a maximum of 150 fields per MS, for a use case with *perchanweightdensity=False*, *mosweight=True* tclean will encounter too many open files with ~46 MSs or more, while with *perchanweightdensity=True*, *mosweight=True* tclean will encounter too many open files with ~300 MSs or more.\n",

        "-    The use of the *\"centerbox*\" parameter when specifying a region in **imstat** has a known issue that under very specific circumstances, less pixels are taken into account for the statistics than what is expected. This only occurs when all of the following are true: (1) values are specified in pixels; (2) the width of the box is an even number of pixels (e.g, 4pix, 16pix, or 100pix); and (3) the box is located away from the image center in Right Ascension (progressively more pixels are dropped when moving away from the image center, but only in RA). The issue is a combination of machine rounding errors (when the boundary of the centerbox is exactly at the center of a pixel), and the fact that centerbox has to converts pixel coordinates to sky coordinates to allow all possible combinations of regions. Note that the \"*box*\" parameter is not affected by this, because it can be more strict in only using flat pixel coordinates.    As a simple work-around solution, we recommend to always give the width of the centerbox in \"odd\" number of pixels. Please note that because centerbox places the center of a box in the middle of a pixel and CASA only includes full pixels, the width of a centerbox always has an odd number of pixels anyway. For example, `centerbox=[[1000pix,4000pix],[4pix,4pix]]` for an 8000x8000 pixel image should give npts=25, but due to the above issue will result in `npts <25`. Instead, `centerbox=[[1000pix,4000pix],[5pix,5pix]]` will always give npts=25.\n",
