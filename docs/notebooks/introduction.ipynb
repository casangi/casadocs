Previously tclean was looking at .casa/config.py for the location of the distro data but only considering the root data directory existence and not checking existence of the data (more specifically, antenna response data) actually used by it. These have now been fixed to look at the correct casadata distro location, which varies depending on whether it is CASA 5 or 6 and is a tarball or built from source.\n",

        "**Error handling:** All CASA tasks now follow a consistent error handling approach. In CASA 6, when imported from casatasks, all tasks will raise exceptions in case of a severe errror.

        "-   When imaging large mosaics with *mosweight* in **tclean**, an error *\\\"too many open files\\\"* may occur that may require to increase the limit for open files.\n",

        "-   CASA is not using *LD_LIBRARY_PATH* anymore but *CASALD_LIBRARY_PATH* to avoid confusion.      \n",
        "-   **cvel** is calculating the velocity incorrectly for ephemeris objects. We recommend to use **mstransform** or its offspring **cvel2**, although the latter should be used with care as it is not fully commissioned yet.\n",
        "-   When running CASA with the pipeline option *\\'casa \\--pipeline\\'*, **plotcal** may not show all plots and comes up with an error message. Use CASA without *\\'\\--pipeline\\'* when performing interactive data reduction.\n",
        "-   **fixvis** uses the small angle approximation and may be incorrect for large phase shifts. Use **tclean** for phase center shifts during imaging when applicable. \n",
        "-   With parallel calibration on MMS files, **fixvis** does not write out the the new MMS specified in *outputvis* correctly, hence fixvis solutions are not applied when writing to a new MMS.\n",
        "-   In **fringefit**, calibration tables created with CASA 5.5 and before cannot be used with CASA 5.6 and later.\n",
        "-   In **tclean**, defining image cubes in optical velocity in some cases is known not to work.\n",
        "-   After opening and closing an image with **imview** in CASA 6.1.0, **interactive tclean** no longer works.\n",

        "    -   In **tclean**, the gridders *'mosaic'* and *'awproject'* include aperture illumination functions in the gridding convolution functions used for the PSF generation.  Although this strictly follows the math, it has several undesirable features especially in the situation where data are not uniform across all axes across which they are being combined (i.e. if the mosaic pattern is not relatively flat, if the center of the image has no mosaic pointing, if different pointings have drastically different uv-coverages or frequency coverages). All such variations cause the PSFs to be position-dependent and could relate to potential instabilities during deconvolution, either requiring many major cycles to converge or diverging.  For spectral-cube imaging, the effects are lower because PSFs are normalized to peak 1 no matter what their raw peak values are. For multi-term imaging, the ratios between the spectral PSF central values matter and the effect/error is enhanved. When all these uv-coverage variations are avoided (in careful simulations), both algorithms perform as expected for joint wideband mosaics (both with *conjbeams=True* or *False*). For CASA 5.7/6.1, the guidelines are:    -   Full-field, single pointing imaging (spectral cube as well as multi-term) will be accurate as long as the image phase center matches the PB pointing center.  \n",
        "    -   For multi-term wideband joint mosaics, we recommend the use of *gridder=\\'awproject\\'* with *conjbeams=True* as that is the only combination that has demonstrated accurate wideband pb-correction (at *niter=0*) especially in the presence of position-dependent uv-coverage. All other options will need monitoring and several major cycles to ensure convergence.  The image should ideally be centered on a PB center.\n",
        "    -   For spectral cube joint mosaics, both gridders are usable. The effects of PSF position dependence are limited to shape differences (i.e. the peak values and fluxes will still be correct).

This can happen for both manual and pipeline imaging when using the *'mosweight=True'* parameter. The reason is that in CASA 5.5, a trade-off was made to reduce memory demands in tclean when using mosweight, by placing the weights on disk using multiple files. Unfortunately, this memory fix may cause open file problems for data sets consisting of many MSs and fields. The problem has been characterized based on the number of MSs and fields: with respect to earlier CASA releases, the imager code now uses *\"#MSs x #fields x 2\"* additional files. As a rule of thumb, if the limit of number of files open is 4096, then the *\"too many open files\"* error occurs when \\#MSs x \\#fields \\>= 1500.      \n",

This only occurs when all of the following are true: (1) values are specified in pixels; (2) the width of the box is an even number of pixels (e.g, 4pix, 16pix, or 100pix); and (3) the box is located away from the image center in Right Ascension (progressively more pixels are dropped when moving away from the image center, but only in RA). The issue is a combination of machine rounding errors (when the boundary of the centerbox is exactly at the center of a pixel), and the fact that centerbox has to converts pixel coordinates to sky coordinates to allow all possible combinations of regions. Note that the \"*box*\" parameter is not affected by this, because it can be more strict in only using flat pixel coordinates.    As a simple work-around solution, we recommend to always give the width of the centerbox in \"odd\" number of pixels. Please note that because centerbox places the center of a box in the middle of a pixel and CASA only includes full pixels, the width of a centerbox always has an odd number of pixels anyway. For example, `centerbox=[[1000pix,4000pix],[4pix,4pix]]` for an 8000x8000 pixel image should give npts=25, but due to the above issue will result in `npts <25`.
