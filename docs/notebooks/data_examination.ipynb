Some axis choices do not apply to calibration tables, and the calibration axes do not apply to MeasurementSets. Selection can be applied to calibration tables; where relevant, channel selection has been implemented and tested for the cal tables listed.

Sometimes, however, the data changes on disk, for example when other data processing tasks are applied. To force plotms to reload the data, check the *Reload* box next to the *Plot* button or press the SHIFT key while clicking the *Plot* button.\n",
        "\n",
        "For plots of large numbers of points, the total memory requirement can be quite large. **plotms** attempts to predict the memory it will require (typically 5 or 6 bytes per plotted point when only one axis is a data axis, depending upon the data shapes involved), and will complain if it believes there is insufficient memory to support the requested plot. For most practical interactive purposes (plots that load and draw in less than a few or a few 10s of minutes), there is usually not a problem on typical modern workstations.  Attempts to plot large datasets on small laptops might be more likely to encounter problems here.\n",
        "\n",
        "The absolute upper limit on the number of simultaneously plotted points is currently set by the ability to index the points in the cache. For modern 64 bit machines, this is about 4.29 billion points (requiring around 25GB of memory). Such plots are not especially useful interactively, since the I/O and draw become prohibitive.In general, it is usually most efficient to plot data in modest chunks of no more than a few hundred million points or less, either using selection or averaging. Note that all iterations are (currently) cached simultaneously for iterated plots, so iteration is not a way to manage memory use. A few hundred million points tends to be the practical limit of interactive **plotms** use with respect to information content and utility in the resulting plots, especially when you consider the number of available pixels on your screen.\n",
