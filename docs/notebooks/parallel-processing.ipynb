One extra step necessary to run **tclean** in parallel is to set the parameter *parallel=True*.

When this is done with the Multi-MS structure the thresholds calculated in the first pass might differ from the thresholds that would be calculated using a single MS structure. This is due to the fact that in the Multi-MS structure the data are partitioned into Sub-MSs. The default is to produce a balanced partition with respect to the SPWs and scans, with the aim to get content from all SPWs and scans into each of the Sub-MSs. For this reason, the statistics calculated by RFlag may differ across Sub-MSs, as they would differ for different data selections. At the moment this issue has not been assessed thoroughly for real-world datasets. A related question that is not understood in detail at the moment, and that can affect both serial and parallel runs of RFlag, is how much the thresholds can differ between the single pass and dual pass modes of RFlag.\n",

        "This section explains technical details aimed at advanced users and system administrators who are interested in knowing more about different forms of parallelization in CASA, customizing processes and threads in CASA sessions,  and/or optimizing performance. Most users would not normally need to be aware of or modify these settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "The parallelization approach described in this chapter, embarrassingly parallel, is based on multiprocessing. Certain areas of CASA also use a different form of parallelization,  multithreading (via [OpenMP](http://www.openmp.org)). By default, mpicasa disables multithreading. This is to prevent competition for CPU cores between OpenMP threads and MPI processes, given that OpenMP would spawn as many threads as cores are available. In other words, if CASA is started with `mpicasa -n 8 ...`, 8 processes are spawned but no additional threads are spawned.\n",
        "\n",
        "The mechanism used to disable multithreading is the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable. When CASA is run under mpicasa, the mpicasa wrapper sets the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to 1 before starting CASA, unless it has previously been set by the user in which case it is not modified. This effectively disables OpenMP multithreading unless the user has set explicitly a number of threads in OMP_NUM_THREADS. \n",
        "\n",
        "To use hybrid parallel approaches, with *X* processes and *Y* threads per process, the user can set OMP_NUM_THREADS to *Y* and then start CASA using \n",
        "`mpicasa -n X...`. Hybrid setups are not validated and not particularly recommended.\n",
        "For more details on this and other related environment variables that control OpenMP multithreading please refer to the [OpenMP documentation](https://www.openmp.org). [Imager Parallelization](synthesis_imaging.ipynb#Imager-Parallelization) explains how multiprocessing and multithreading are used in imaging."
