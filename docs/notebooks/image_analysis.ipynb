The **imhead **task can be used to confirm the axis specifications in the data cube of interest, and the axes may differ from the above sequence, particularly when using FITS data cubes or CASA images that were converted from FITS files.

If specific channels are specified through chans, the task will select that segment of the spectral axis (e.g. *chans = '30~45'* will operate on channels 30 through 45).  In the same way, stokes selects specific Stokes parameter axes, as e.g. *stokes = 'I'*.

Header metadata can also store notes on the observation and/or calibration and image processing.

Alternatively, axes can be specified by their names. E.g., to reorder an image with right ascension, declination, and frequency and reverse the first two, *order=['declination', 'right ascension', 'frequency']* will work. The axes names can be found typing **ia.coordsys**.**names**. Minimum match is supported, so that *order=\\['d', 'f', 'r']* will produce the same results.Axes can simultaneously be transposed and reversed. To reverse an axis, precede it by a '-'. For example, *order='-10-32'* will reverse the direction of the first and third axis of the input image (the zeroth and second axes in the output image).Example (swap the stokes and spectral axes in an RA-Dec-Stokes-Frequency image):\n",

And the axis along which to do these calculations need not be the spectral axis (i.e. do moments along Dec for a RA-Velocity image). We will treat all of these as generalized instances of a \"moment\" map.The **immoments** task will compute basic moment images from a cube. The default inputs are:\n",

Choices are: \\'ra\\', \\'dec\\', \\'lat\\', \\'long\\', \\'spectral\\', or \\'stokes\\'. A standard moment-0 or moment-1 image of a spectral cube would use the default choice 'spectral'. One could make a position-velocity map by setting \\'ra\\' or \\'dec\\'.The *includepix* and *excludepix* parameters are used to set ranges for the inclusion and exclusion of pixels based on values. For example, *includepix=\\[0.05,100.0\\]* will include pixels with values from 50 mJy to 1000 Jy, and *excludepix=\\[100.0,1000.0\\]* will exclude pixels with values from 100 to 1000 Jy.If a single moment is chosen, the outfile specifies the exact name of the output image. If multiple moments are chosen, then outfile will be used as the root of the output filenames, which will get different suffixes for each moment. For image cubes that contain different beam sizes for each plane, **immoments** will smooth all planes to the largest beam size first, then collapse to the desired moment.\n",

This is so that the (presumably) zero-mean noise fluctuations in off-line parts of the image cube will cancel out. If you image has large biases, like a pronounced clean bowl due to missing large-scale flux, then your moment-0 image will be biased also. It will be difficult to alleviate this with a threshold, but you can try.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make a usable moment-1 (or higher) image, on the other hand, it is critical to set a reasonable threshold to exclude noise from being added to the moment maps. Something like a few times the rms noise level in the usable planes seems to work (put into *includepix* or *excludepix* as needed). Also use *chans* to ignore channels with bad data.\n",

All restrictions are relative to a reference Gaussian (the zero'th component of each multiplet). *gncomps* specifies the number of Gaussians for each multiplets, and, in fact, a number of these multiplets can be fit simultaneously. *gncomps=\\[2,4,3\\]*, e.g. fits a 2-component Gaussian, a 4-component Gaussian, and a 3-component Gaussian all at once. The initial parameter estimates can be specified with the *gmampest*, *gmcenterest*, and *gmfwhmest* parameters and the estimates are simply listed in the sequence of *gncomps*. E.g. if *gncomps=\\[2,4,3\\]* is specified with multiplet G0 consisting of 2 Gaussians a, b, multiplet G1 of 4 Gaussians c, d, e, f, and multiplet G2 of three Gaussians g, h, i, the parameter list in *gm\\*est* would be like *gm\\*est=\\[a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i\\]*.Restrictions can be specified via the *gmampcon* parameter for the amplitude ratio (non-reference to reference), *gmcentercon* for the offset in pixels (to a reference), and *gmfwhmcon* for the FWHM ratio (non-reference to reference). A value of 0 will not constrain anything. The reference is always the zero'th component in each multiplet, in our example, Gaussians a, c, and g. They cannot be constrained. So *gmncomps=\\[2, 4, 3\\]*, *gmampcon= \\[ 0 , 0.2, 0 , 0.1, 4.5, 0 \\]*, *gcentercon=\\[24.2, 45.6, 92.7, 0 , -22.8, -33.5\\],* and *gfwhmcon=\\' \\'* would constrain Gaussians b relative to a with a 24.2 pixel offset, Gaussian d to c with a amplitude ratio of 0.2 and a 45.6 pixel offset, Gaussian e to c with a offset of 92.7 pixels, etc. Restrictions will overrule any estimates.The parameters *goodamprange*, *goodcenterrange*, and *goodfwhmrange* can be used to limit the range of amplitude, center, and fwhm solutions for all Gaussians.\n",

        "This task generates the rotation measure image from stokes Q and U measurements at several different frequencies. You are required to specify the name of at least one image with a polarization axis containing stokes Q and U planes and with a frequency axis containing more than two pixels. The frequencies do not have to be equally spaced (i.e. the frequency coordinate can be a tabular coordinate). It will work out the position angle images for you. You may also specify multiple image names, in which case these images will first be concatenated along the spectral axis using **ia.imageconcat**. The requirements are that for all images, the axis order must be the same and the number of pixels along each axis must be identical, except for the spectral axis which may differ in length between images. The spectral axis need not be contiguous from one image to another. See also the i**magepol.fourierrotationmeasure** function for a new Fourier-based approach.Rotation measure algorithms that work robustly are few. The main problem is in trying to account for the $n- \\pi$ ambiguity (see Leahy et al.1986 - Appendix A.1) [\\[1\\]](#Bibliography) and the [MIRIAD manual](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/sma/miriad/manuals/SMAuguide/smauserhtml/imrm.html).\n",

An image containing the number of $n- \\pi$ turns that were added to the data at each spatial pixel and for which the best fit was found can be written. The reduced $\\chi^2$ image for the fits can also be written. Any combination of output images can be written.\n",

But if it proves to be inaccurate (maybe not many signal-free pixels), it may be specified. This is used for calculating the error in the position angles (via propagation of Gaussian errors).The argument *maxpaerr* specifies the maximum allowable error in the position angle that is acceptable. The default is an infinite value. From the standard propagation of errors, the error in the linearly polarized position angle is determined from the Stokes Q and U images (at each directional pixel for each frequency). If the position angle error for any pixel exceeds the specified value, the position angle at that pixel is omitted from the fit. The process generates an error for the fit and this is used to compute the errors in the output images.\n",

In the case of fitting a spectral index, which is traditionally represented as $\\alpha$, is equal to $c_1$. In both cases, $D$ is a normalization constant used so that abscissa values are closer to unity when they are sent to the fitter. This generally improves the probability that the fit will converge. This parameter may be specified via the *div* parameter. A value of 0 (the default) indicates that the application should determine a reasonable value for $D$, which is determined via$D = 10^{\\int(\\log10(\\sqrt(\\min(x)*\\max(x)))}$where *min(x)* and *max(x)* are the minimum and maximum abscissa values, respectively.The inputs are:\n",

Kernels *'gauss'* and *'boxcar'* need the major and minor axes sizes as input, the Gaussian kernel smoothing also requires a position angle. By default, the kernel size defines the kernel itself, i.e. the data will be smoothed with this *kernel*. If the *targetres* parameter for Gaussian kernels is set to *'True'*, major and minor axes will be those from the output resolution, and the kernel will be adjusted for each plane to arrive at the final resolution. The 'commonbeam' kernel is to be used when the beam shape is different as a function of frequency. This option will then smooth all planes to a single beam, defined by the largest beam in the cube. With the *'image'* kernel, one can specify an image that will serve as the convolution kernel. A scale factor can be applied, which defaults to flux conservation where units are Jy/beam or Jy/beam.km/s. For all other units, like K, the output will be scaled by the inverse of the convolution kernel. e.g., in the extreme case of a flat distribution the values before and after smoothing will be the same.\n",

The latter format is very useful when different masks are combined or manipulated. All the image analysis tools, in particular **immath** are applicable for such zero/non-zero masks as they act like normal images. **makemask** will always attempt to regrid the input mask to the output image.In addition *mode='copy'* can be used to merge masks and also accepts regions.

However, when using the true [C++ interface](image_analysis.ipynb#Lattice-Expression-Language) to classes like `LatticeExprNode`, one can easily use memory-based lattices. In that case it can be advantageous to pay attention to this optimization.\n",
