If you instead double-click outside the rectangle, you will zoom out.\n",

Note: The arrow keys, Page Up, Page Down, Home and End keys can also be used to pan through your data any time you are zoomed in. (Click on the main display area first, to be sure the keyboard is 'focused' there).\n",

Note that you can also adjust the color table quantitatively inside the *Data Display Options* window.\n",

Click on the desired position with the tool's mouse button to place the point; once placed you can drag it to other locations. You can also place multiple points on the display (e.g. for different spectral profile positions) -- remove them by hovering over and hitting ESC. Double-click is not needed for this tool. See *Viewer Region Positioning* for more detail.\n",
        "-   RECTANGLE, ELLIPSE, and POLYGON REGION DRAWING: The rectangle region tool is assigned to the right mouse button by default. As with the zoom tool, a rectangle region is generated by dragging with the assigned mouse button; the selection is confirmed by double-clicking within the rectangle. An ellipse regions is created by dragging with the assigned mouse button. In the case of an elliptical region, both the elliptical region and its surrounding rectangle are shown on the display. The selection is confirmed by double-clicking within the ellipse. Polygon regions are created by clicking the assigned mouse button at the desired vertices and then clicking the final location twice to finish. Once created, a polygon can be moved by dragging from inside, or reshaped by dragging the handles at the vertices. See *Viewer Region Positioning* for the uses of this tool.\n",
        "-   POLYLINE DRAWING: A polyline can be created by selecting this tool. It is manipulated similarly to the polygon region tool: create segments by clicking at the desired positions and then double-click to finish the line.\n",
        "-   DISTANCE TOOL (ruler): After selecting the distance tool by assigning a mouse button to it, distances on the image can conveniently be measured by dragging the mouse with the assigned button pressed. The tool measures the distances along the world coordinate axes and along the hypotenuse. If the units in both axes are \\[deg\\], the distances are displayed in \\[arcsec\\].\n",

The exception to this rule is that the process is less forgiving if you save the display of an LEL expression. In this case the files must be in the locations specified in the original LEL expression. If a data file is not found, restore will attempt to proceed but results may not be ideal.Manually Editing Saved Display Panel States: The saved \\\"Restore\\\" files are in ascii (xml) format, and manual edits are possible. However, these files are long and complex. Use caution, and back up restore files before editing. If you make a mistake, the viewer may not even recognize the file as a restore file. It is easier and safer to make changes on the display panel and then save the display panel state again.\n"

The images used in the LEL expression should have the same coordinates and extents.MeasurementSets: A MeasurementSet can only be displayed as a raster. For MeasurementSets, the load tab offers options for data selection.

In this case, the viewer will interpolate (using the selected interpolation scheme) the cube on disk to share the same velocity gridding as the loaded coordinates. This can be used, e.g. to overlay contour maps of different spectral lines or to make synchronized movies of multiple cubes.

All open datasets will have a tab in the Data Display Options window, whether currently registered or not. When a data set is registered to a Display Panel its coordinates are aligned to the master coordinate image in the panel and it is ready for drawing. If multiple Display Panels are open then a data set may be registered on one Display Panel and not on another. Only those data sets registered on a particular Display Panel show up in its Cursors Panel.Why Register More Than One Image? It is useful to have more than one image registered on a panel if you are displaying a contour image over a raster image, to 'blink' between images, or to compare images using the Cursors Panel.Unregistering Images: A data set can be registered or unregistered using the Image Manager in the Data drop down menu or the Image Manager icon (third from left). This icon will open the Image Manager window and the checkboxes can be used to register or unregister an image.Closing vs. Unregistering: You can close a data set that is no longer needed using the Close option in the Data drop-down menu, the \\\"Close\\\" icon (fourth from left), or right mouse button \"Close\" selection in the *Image Manager*.If you close a dataset, you must reload it from disk (or recreate it if it's an LEL expression, regridded image, moment or something similar) to see it again. If you unregister a dataset, it will draw immediately if you re-register it, with its options as you have previously set them. In general, close unneeded datasets but unregister those that you intend to use again.\n",

In this case, four images are loaded into the viewer. The sequence of images can be changed by dragging and dropping the images to new positions in the stack. The letter to the left indicates whether the image is a Raster, Contour, Vector, or Marker image. MC marks the coordinate master, in this case the second image. The checkboxes are to change the registration statuses. The Coordinate Master image can be defined by a right mouse click, and selecting the corresponding option. The right mouse menu button also offers options for quick changes between contour and raster images and to close an image. The Options button will open a drop-down box (as shown in *Image Manager* for the first image), in which one can again change between image type, change to a different rest frequency (or \"Reset\" to the value in the image header), or open the \\\"Display Options\\\" panel for that specific image.\n",
