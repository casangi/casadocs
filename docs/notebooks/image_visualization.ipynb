An ellipse regions is created by dragging with the assigned mouse button. In the case of an elliptical region, both the elliptical region and its surrounding rectangle are shown on the display. The selection is confirmed by double-clicking within the ellipse. Polygon regions are created by clicking the assigned mouse button at the desired vertices and then clicking the final location twice to finish. Once created, a polygon can be moved by dragging from inside, or reshaped by dragging the handles at the vertices. See *Viewer Region Positioning* for the uses of this tool.\n",

It is advisable but not required to retain the file's \\'.rstr\\' (\\\"Restore\\\") extension.You can restore the display panel to the saved state by loading the saved state from the Data Manager Panel, by selecting Restore Panel State from the Display Panel drop down menu, or by clicking the \\\"Restore Display Panel State\\\" icon (just to the right of the \\\"Save Display Panel State\\\" icon).It is possible to restore panel states viewing MeasurementSets, images, or panel states that have multiple layers, such as contour plots over raster images. You can also save LEL displays. You can also the save or restore the panel state with no data loaded, which is a convenient way to restore preferred initial settings such as overall panel size.Data Locations: The viewer is fairly forgiving regarding data location when restoring a saved panel state. It will find files located:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   in the original location recorded in the restore file\n",
        "-   in the current working directory (where you started the viewer)\n",
        "-   in the restore file's directory\n",
        "-   in the original location relative to the restore file\n",
        "\n",
        "This means that you can generally restore a saved panel state if you move that file together with data files. The exception to this rule is that the process is less forgiving if you save the display of an LEL expression. In this case the files must be in the locations specified in the original LEL expression. If a data file is not found, restore will attempt to proceed but results may not be ideal.Manually Editing Saved Display Panel States: The saved \\\"Restore\\\" files are in ascii (xml) format, and manual edits are possible. However, these files are long and complex. Use caution, and back up restore files before editing. If you make a mistake, the viewer may not even recognize the file as a restore file. It is easier and safer to make changes on the display panel and then save the display panel state again.\n"

This can be entered in the box provided after you click the \\\"LEL\\\" box. The images used in the LEL expression should have the same coordinates and extents.MeasurementSets: A MeasurementSet can only be displayed as a raster. For MeasurementSets, the load tab offers options for data selection. This will reduce loading and processing times for visibility flagging.Regridding Images on Load: Optionally, you may regrid the velocity axis of an image you wish to load to match the current coordinates grid in the Display Panel. In this case, the viewer will interpolate (using the selected interpolation scheme) the cube on disk to share the same velocity gridding as the loaded coordinates. This can be used, e.g. to overlay contour maps of different spectral lines or to make synchronized movies of multiple cubes. Note that the regridding depends on the rest frequency in the image, which is used to calculate the velocities used in regridding.\n",

        "When you load data as described above, it is first opened, and then registered on all existing Display Panels. An open dataset has been prepared in memory from disk. All open datasets will have a tab in the Data Display Options window, whether currently registered or not. When a data set is registered to a Display Panel its coordinates are aligned to the master coordinate image in the panel and it is ready for drawing. If multiple Display Panels are open then a data set may be registered on one Display Panel and not on another. Only those data sets registered on a particular Display Panel show up in its Cursors Panel.Why Register More Than One Image? It is useful to have more than one image registered on a panel if you are displaying a contour image over a raster image, to 'blink' between images, or to compare images using the Cursors Panel.Unregistering Images: A data set can be registered or unregistered using the Image Manager in the Data drop down menu or the Image Manager icon (third from left). This icon will open the Image Manager window and the checkboxes can be used to register or unregister an image.Closing vs. Unregistering: You can close a data set that is no longer needed using the Close option in the Data drop-down menu, the \\\"Close\\\" icon (fourth from left), or right mouse button \"Close\" selection in the *Image Manager*.If you close a dataset, you must reload it from disk (or recreate it if it's an LEL expression, regridded image, moment or something similar) to see it again. If you unregister a dataset, it will draw immediately if you re-register it, with its options as you have previously set them. In general, close unneeded datasets but unregister those that you intend to use again.\n",

The panel can be invoked from the \"Manage Images\" tool, the third icon from the left (two overlapping squares).An example is shown in *Image Manager* figure. In this case, four images are loaded into the viewer. The sequence of images can be changed by dragging and dropping the images to new positions in the stack. The letter to the left indicates whether the image is a Raster, Contour, Vector, or Marker image. MC marks the coordinate master, in this case the second image. The checkboxes are to change the registration statuses. The Coordinate Master image can be defined by a right mouse click, and selecting the corresponding option. The right mouse menu button also offers options for quick changes between contour and raster images and to close an image. The Options button will open a drop-down box (as shown in *Image Manager* for the first image), in which one can again change between image type, change to a different rest frequency (or \"Reset\" to the value in the image header), or open the \\\"Display Options\\\" panel for that specific image.\n",
