By the term *data*, we refer to the data columns present in a MeasurementSet (DATA, CORRECTED_DATA, etc.). The data always have a companion FLAG column, with matching dimensions. The data also have other companion columns related to weights: WEIGHT, SIGMA, WEIGHT_SPECTRUM, SIGMA_SPECTRUM. The focus of this page is on data flags. But data average, and the use of the data weights in the average, also plays a role in the explanations below.

The averaged flag will be set only if all the flags in the input bin are set. Let us first illustrate this with examples. For simplicity we consider some examples of channel average. The flags for every data channel are represented by an \\'X\\' (flag set) or a \\'O\\' (flag unset). There are 12 channels and we try different channel bins:\n",

As a convention, $f_i = 1$ when the flag is set (i.e., the visibility is \"flagged\"), and $f_i = 0$ when the flag is not set (i.e., the visibility is \"unflagged\").

When one or more of the data in the input bin are no flagged, only the data that are not flagged are used in the average. The flagged data in the original bin are excluded from the average. These are the two possible scenarios:\n",

Naturally, this will change the shape of the spectral features to some extent. According to the Nyquist theorem you should oversample a spectrum with twice the numbers of channels to retain the shape. Based on some tests, however, we recommend to observe with at least 3-4 times the number of channels for each significant spectral feature (like 3-4 channels per linewidth).

        "After general calibration is done and if there is significant continuum emission present in what is intended as a spectral line observation, continuum subtraction may be desirable. You can estimate and subtract continuum emission in the $uv$-domain prior to imaging or wait and subtract an estimate of it in the image-plane. Note that neither method is ideal, and the choice depends primarily upon the distribution and strength of the continuum emission. Subtraction in the $uv$-domain is desirable if continuum emission dominates the source, since deconvolution of the line emission will be more robust if it not subject to the deconvolution errors of the brighter continuum. There is also a performance benefit since the continuum is nearly the same in each channel of the observation, and it is desirable to avoid repeating its deconvolution in each channel. However, doing the continuum estimation in the $uv$-domain has the serious drawback that interpolating visibilities between channels is only a good approximation for emission from near the phase center. Thus, $uv$-domain based continuum subtraction will do an increasingly poor job for emission distributed further from the phase center. If the continuum emission is relatively weak, it is usually adequate to subtract it in the image plane; this is described in the Image Analysis section of this document. Here, we describe how to do continuum subtraction in the $uv$-domain.\n",

        "A good review of different approaches to the subtraction of the continuum emission is found in Cornwell, Uson & Haddad (1992) [\\[1\\].](#Bibliography)\n",
        "\n",
        "Sault (1994) [\\[2\\]](#Bibliography) gives the detailed analysis of the $uv$-domain based algorithms. We assume here that the sky brightness $I_\\nu$ at a sky position $(l,m)$ is composed of the continuum (C) and line (L) emission such that $I_\\nu(l,m)=C_\\nu(l,m)+L_\\nu(l,m)$. The continuum is estimated from fitting a polynomial selecting only \\\"line-free\\\" channels. The fitting of the visibiity spectrum is generally done for each sampling and separately for real and imaginary parts to make it a linear process. Then the polynomial continuum model is subtracted from all channels. Note that because the real and imaginary parts are fitted separately, the fitted model amplitude has the functional form of sqrt(*polynomial of order fitorder* *2) which, in general, is not a polynomial.\n",
        "\n",
        "This technique is known to work well when the dominant continuum source is at or near phase center. Its effectiveness tends to decline as distance to the source location with respect to the phase center increases and thus residual continuum left in the subtracted data increases. The effectiveness which has the same expression as in bandwidth smearing, can be parameterized as $\\eta=\\frac{\\Delta\\nu}{\\nu}\\frac{l_{0}}{\\theta_{synth}}$ in terms of the the distance in the synthesized beam ($l_{0}/\\theta_{synth}$) from the phase center,  where $\\nu$ and 2$\\Delta\\nu$ are the observing frequency and the bandwidth, respectively. In order to the method to work well, $\\eta << 1$ must be met. If the brightest continuum emission lies beyond $\\frac{\\nu}{\\Delta\\nu}$ beams from the phase center the source need to be shifted before fitting.\n",

        "CASA 6.5 has introduced a new uvcontsub task. Its aim is to consolidate $uv$-domain continuum subtraction in one task and to replace other implementations available in different tasks. Older tasks to do $uv$-domain continuum subtraction are: uvcontsub_old, and mstransform. Other variants have been removed. The current plan is for uvcontsub to replace uvcontsub_old and the continuum subtraction functionality of mstransform. All of these tasks are based on the same basic concept described above and achieve essentially the same output but offer different interfaces and are based on different underlying implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "uvcontsub is based on the same code infrastructure as mstransform and has been defined to better support the workflow of pipelines in operations. uvcontsub has been used as the standard task to do $uv$ continuum subtraction job and it is based on calibrator tool (\\'cb\\') to solve for continuum by fitting a polynomial. It creates an \\'A\\'-type (\\'additive noise\\') caltable which will be deleted before the task exits. This solution is applied to correct (or subtract) the rest of the data. uvconstub3 is an experimental task  built with C++ code outside the calibrator tool in order to eliminate some of the extra IOs involved in use of the cb tool. More recently mstransform has been developed to consolidate all visibility data manipulation functions to one task. A new parameter to perform continuum subtraction (douvcontsub) was introduced in mstransform in CASA 4.7.\n",

From the definition of the chi-squared cost function, the weights have a direct multiplicative effect on the relevance of every channel. The channel weights, adjusted for example using the statwt task influence how relevant different channels will be for the fitting, in a more gradual way than the *fitspec* parameter.\n",

        "Regarding the flags, as a convention, $f_c = 1$ when the flag is set (i.e., the visibility is \"flagged\"), and $f_c = 0$ when the flag is not set. Those channels for which their flags are set are excluded from the set of data points fitted ($(\\nu_c, Re(d_c))$). Channels that are flagged are effectively excluded for the purpose of fitting.

If your scans are short enough you can also use scan averaging with *combine='scan'* and *solint='inf'.* Be warned, setting solint too large will introduce \"time smearing\" in the estimated continuum and thus not properly subtract emission not at the phase center. Increasing *solint* speeds up the calculation but it does not improve the overall result quality of **uvcontsub_old** - although the continuum estimates of each baseline may be noisy (just like each visibility in a continuum MS may be noisy), it is better to use the ensemble of individual fits than to average the ensemble before fitting.

Such fitting has its origins in early interferometry, especially VLBI, where arrays consisted of only a few antennas and the calibration and deconvolution problems were poorly constrained. These methods overcame the calibration uncertainties by fitting the models to calibration-independent closure quantities and the deconvolution problem by drastically limiting the number of free parameters required to describe the visibilities. Today, even with larger and better calibrated arrays, it is still desirable to use visibility model fitting in order to extract geometric properties such as the positions and sizes of discrete components in radio sources. Fits for physically meaningful component shapes such as disks, rings, and optically-thin spheres, though idealized, enable connecting source geometry directly to the physics of the emission regions.\n",

For points, there are three inputs: I (total flux density), and relative direction (RA, Dec) offsets (in arcsec) from the observation's phase center. For Gaussians, there are three additional inputs: the Gaussian's semi-major axis width (arcsec), the aspect ratio, and position angle (degrees). It should be understood that the quality of the result is very sensitive to the starting inputs provided by the user. If this first guess is not sufficiently close to the global χ2 minimum, the algorithm will happily converge to an incorrect local minimum. In fact, the χ2 surface, as a function of the component's relative direction inputs, has a shape very much like the inverse of the absolute value of the dirty image of the field. Any peak in this image (positive or negative) corresponds to a local χ2 minimum that could conceivable capture the fit. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that the correct minimum does the capturing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Currently, **uvmodelfit** relies on the likelihood that the source is very near the phase center (within a beamwidth) and/or the user's savvy in specifying the starting parameters. This fairly serious constraint will soon be relieved somewhat by enabling a rudimentary form of uv-domain weighting to increase the likelihood that the starting guess is on a slope in the correct χ2 valley.\n",
