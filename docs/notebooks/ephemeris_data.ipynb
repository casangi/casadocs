        "Since ALMA Cycle 3, the ALMA observatory includes in each raw dataset (SDM) all necessary ephemerides in the so-called Ephemeris table, an XML file which corresponds to the ephemeris used during the observation. Upon import to MS format, the task **importasdm** will translate the xml ephemerides into separate CASA ephemeris tables for each field, which have the same format as those used by the task **setjy**. Examples can be found in the subdirectory \\\"data/ephemerides/JPL-Horizons\\\" in each CASA distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "The ephemeris tables are automatically attached to the corresponding field(s) and can be used whenever needed. They have two main use cases:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  An ephemeris table is necessary for the *spectral* frame transformation of the visibilities to the source rest frame *permanently* when creating a new MS using the tasks **cvel, cvel2,** or **mstransform,** or *on-the-fly* during imaging using the task **tclean** by setting the parameter *specmode* to \\\"cubesource\\\". The ephemeris provides the location of the phase center and the radial velocity of the target.\n",
        "2.  An ephemeris table is also necessary if your observation has tracked some other phase center but you would like to track the location described by the ephemeris. This can be achieved by setting the parameter *phasecenter* of task **tclean** to the string \\\"TRACKFIELD\\\". See the **tclean** documentation for more details.\n",
        "\n",
        "The ephemerides used by ALMA are originally for the observer location of ALMA (topocentric). They use the ICRS coordinate reference frame and typically have a time spacing of ten or twenty minutes. For the later transformation of the spectral reference frame, however, a geocentric ephemeris is necessary. The **importasdm** task will therefore by default also perform a conversion from the ALMA observer location to the geocenter. This is controlled by the **importasdm** parameter *convert_ephem2geo* which is True by default.\n",
        "\n",
        "The spectral reference frame of the visibilities in the SDM is always topocentric (TOPO), the observer reference frame. To analyze spectral lines in an ephemeris source, it can be helpful to transform the visibilities to the source rest spectral frame (REST). This is in particular necessary when the velocity of the source varies significantly throughout the observation (which can, e.g., happen if the observation is spread over serveral days). As mentioned above, this offline software Doppler-shift correction can be achieved in two ways, either permanently or on-the-fly. This is described further below.\n",
        "\n",
        "When an ephemeris is attached to a field of the MS FIELD table, the object position does not correspond to the direction columns of the FIELD table but is retrieved by linearly interpolating from the ephemeris table for the given time. The nominal entry of the direction column then *changes its meaning to an angular offset* with respect to the ephemeris. Thus, if the field center is exactly at the position described by the ephemeris, the nominal entries of the direction column are zero for right ascension and declination. The offset feature of the FIELD table direction column comes into play in the case of a mosaic: if there are a number of fields with nearby positions, the fields can share an ephemeris; they all reference the same ephemeris table via the optional column EPHEMERIS_ID, but have different offsets in their direction column entries.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Either with either the task **cvel** or its faster implementation **cvel2** (which uses internally the same code as the task **mstransform**) or with **mstransform**, a new MS can be created which contains visibilities in the spectral reference frame of the source. All three tasks should produce the same result. As a matter of fact, an online Doppler-shift tracking corresponding to the velocity of the source at the beginning of the observation is applied during observations. This online correction allows one to tune the spectral windows adequately to match the requested rest frequencies, but the labelling of the spectral frame of the raw data remains in TOPO.\n",
        "\n",
        "The user must set the *outframe* parameter of **cvel**, **cvel2**, or **mstransform** to \\\"SOURCE\\\". This will lead to a transformation from the TOPO to the GEO reference frame followed by an additional time-dependent Doppler correction according to the radial velocity of the object as given by its ephemeris.\n",
        "\n",
        "Such MSes should then be imaged using the setting \\\"cubedata\\\" for the parameter *specmode* in **tclean**. The resulting spectral reference frame in the MS is named \\\"REST\\\".\n",

        "In summary, with ephemerides included in the ALMA raw data and the added support for this in the **importasdm** task, the user rarely needs to worry about how to obtain the right ephemeris in the right format and how to attach it properly to the MS. This process is transparent and only a few logger messages indicate that it is happening (see CASA Docs pages on [\\'Manipulate Ephemeris Objects\\'](ephemeris_data.ipynb#Manipulate-Ephemeris-Objects) if a new ephemeris needs to be added to an existing MS). The correct time-dependent positions, radial velocities, and object distances are used in all relevant tasks such as **listobs**, **plotms**, and, as described above, **cvel**, **cvel2**, **mstransform**, and **tclean**. For Solar-System object flux calibrators, the task **setjy** will, however, only extract the nominal position from the SDM ephemeris and otherwise use its internal set of ephemerides since these contain additionally needed object parameters. Care has to be taken when trying to extract the field positions from the FIELD table as the nominal direction column entries will only be offsets (w.r.t. the ephemeris position) when an ephemeris is attached.\n",

The **importasdm** parameter *polyephem_tabtimestep* can be used to control the step size of the tabulation.\n",

Prior to CASA 4.2, there was no support for ephemeris objects other than the built-in reference frames for the Sun, the Moon, and the planets out to PLUTO. With CASA 4.2, several new features were introduced which help the user to attach an arbitrary ephemeris to a given field and work with the object from calibration to imaging. These can be used when no ephemeris table was provided by the observatory, or in cases where the use of an improved ephemeris table is necessary.\n",

The me tool (see [CASA Tools](../api/casatools.rst) on using the tool kit, as well as the inline help on the me tool inside CASA for specific usage) permits position calculations based on ephemerides in this format. Two examples for such tables can be found in the distribution directory in subdirectory data/ephemerides: VGEO is an ephemeris of Venus in the geocentric reference frame while VTOP is an ephemeris for the same object in the TOPO reference fame for the observatory location of the VLA. With the introduction of solar system source models (Butler) in the **setjy** task, a nearly complete set of ephemerides for the larger bodies in our solar system had to be made available. These are stored in nearly the same format as the above examples VGEO and VTOP (but with a few enhancements) in directory data/ephemerides/JPL-Horizons.

The ephemeris of the field in the first MS will then be used for the merged field. In order to inspect the ephemeris attached to a field, you can find it inside the FIELD subdirectory of your MS. The optional column EPHEMERIS_ID in the FIELD table points to the running number of the ephemeris table. A value of −1 indicates that no ephemeris is attached. Note that in case an ephemeris is attached to a field, the direction column entries for that field in the FIELD table will be interpreted as an offset to the ephemeris direction and are therefore set to (0.,0.) by default. This offset feature is used in mosaic observations where several fields share the same ephemeris with different offsets.
