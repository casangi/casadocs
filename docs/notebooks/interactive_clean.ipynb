        "* Help button : shows keyboard shortcuts\n",
        "* Log button : shows the list of tclean and deconvolve commands that iclean has run\n",
        "* Stokes selection : select which Stokes plane to display\n",
        "* Coordinates selection :  select between world and pixel coordinates\n",
        "* Mask display : controls the color of the mask and if the area is a contour or filled\n",
        "* Cursor location : displays the pixel or world coordinates at the cursor location and the corresponding value of the displayed image and mask. The keyboard shortcut 'f' can be used to freeze the locator at the current cursor position.\n",
        "* Image toolbar : these tools control how the mouse is used to interact with the image raster. The toolbar includes selection of different region drawing tools and buttons to add or subtract from the mask. \n",
        "* Status message : prints the major cycle exit criteria \n",
        "* Run / stop buttons : click to run a single major cycle (single arrow) or multiple cycles (two arrows). When running multiple cycles, click stop to stop after the current major cycle ends.\n",
        "* Channel controls : select the displayed channel by dragging the slider, typing in the channel index or clicking on the arrow buttons. The channel controls are only visible when running on cube image types.\n",
        "* Field selection : use these tabs to select between the primary image and outlier fields\n"

The toolbar near the histogram provides tools to pan, zoom and reset the histogram display.\n",

The location can be frozen with 'f' and resets when the mouse exits and re-enters the raster area. This tab is only available when iclean is running on cube image types.\n",
