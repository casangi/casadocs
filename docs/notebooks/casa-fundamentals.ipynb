        "The visibilities measured by an interferometer must be calibrated before formation of an image. This is because the wavefronts received and processed by the observational hardware have been corrupted by a variety of effects. These include (but are not exclusive to): the effects of transmission through the atmosphere, the imperfect details amplified electronic (digital) signal and transmission through the signal processing system, and the effects of formation of the cross-power spectra by a correlator. Calibration is the process of reversing these effects to arrive at corrected visibilities which resemble as closely as possible the visibilities that would have been measured in vacuum by a perfect system. The subject of this chapter is the determination of these effects by using the visibility data itself.\n",

The visibilities are indicated as vectors spanning the four correlation combinations which can be formed from dual-polarization signals. These four correlations are related directly to the Stokes parameters which fully describe the radiation. The $J_{ij}$ term is therefore a $4\\times4$ matrix. Most of the effects contained in $J_{ij}$ (indeed, the most important of them) are antenna-based, i.e., they arise from measurable physical properties of (or above) individual antenna elements in a synthesis array. Thus, adequate calibration of an array of $N_{ant}$ antennas forming $N_{ant} (N_{ant}-1)/2$ baseline visibilities is usually achieved through the determination of only $N_{ant}$ factors, such that $J_{ij} = J_i \\otimes J_j^{*}$.  For the rest of this chapter, we will usually assume that $J_{ij}$ is factorable in this way, unless otherwise noted.\n",

This complex gain term $G_{ij}$ includes the scale factor for absolute flux density calibration, and may include phase and amplitude corrections due to changes in the atmosphere (in lieu of $T_{ij}$). These gains are polarization-dependent.\n",

        "-   $M_{ij}~=~$ Baseline-based correlator (non-closing) errors. By definition, these are not factorable into antenna-based parts.      \n",
        "Note that the terms are listed in the order in which they affect the incoming wavefront ($G$ and $B$ represent an arbitrary sequence of such terms depending upon the details of the particular electronic system). Note that $M$ differs from all of the rest in that it is not antenna-based, and thus not factorable into terms for each antenna.As written above, the measurement equation is very general; not all observations will require treatment of all effects, depending upon the desired dynamic range. E.g., instrumental polarization calibration can usually be omitted when observing (only) total intensity using circular feeds. Ultimately, however, each of these effects occurs at some level, and a complete treatment will yield the most accurate calibration. Modern high-sensitivity instruments such as ALMA and JVLA will likely require a more general calibration treatment for similar observations with older arrays in order to reach  the advertised dynamic ranges on strong sources.In practice, it is usually far too difficult to adequately measure most calibration effects absolutely (as if in the laboratory) for use in calibration. The effects are usually far too changeable. Instead, the calibration is achieved by making observations of calibrator sources on the appropriate timescales for the relevant effects, and solving the measurement equation for them using the fact that we have $N_{ant}(N_{ant}-1)/2$ measurements and only $N_{ant}$ factors to determine (except for $M$ which is only sparingly used). Note: By partitioning the calibration factors into a series of consecutive effects, it might appear that the number of free parameters is some multiple of $N_{ant}$, but the relative algebra and timescales of the different effects, as well as the  multiplicity of observed polarizations and channels compensate, and it can be shown that the problem remains  well-determined until, perhaps, the effects are direction-dependent within the field of view. Limited solvers for such effects are under study; the **calibrater** tool currently only handles effects which may be assumed constant within the field of view. Corrections for the primary beam are handled in the **imager** tool.  Once determined, these terms are used to correct the visibilities measured for the scientific target. This procedure is known as cross-calibration (when only phase is considered, it is called phase-referencing).\n",
        "\n",
        "The best calibrators are point sources at the phase center (constant visibility amplitude, zero phase), with sufficient flux density to determine the calibration factors with adequate SNR on the relevant timescale. The primary gain calibrator must be sufficiently close to the target on the sky so that its observations sample the same atmospheric effects. A bandpass calibrator usually must be sufficiently strong (or observed with sufficient duration) to provide adequate per-channel sensitivity for a useful calibration. In practice, several calibrators are usually observed, each with properties suitable for one or more of the required calibrations.Synthesis calibration is inherently a bootstrapping process. First, the dominant calibration term is determined, and then, using this result, more subtle effects are solved for, until the full set of required calibration terms is available for application to the target field. The solutions for each successive term are relative to the previous terms. Occasionally, when the several calibration terms are not sufficiently orthogonal, it is useful to re-solve for earlier types using the results for later types, in effect, reducing the effect of the later terms on the solution for earlier ones, and thus better isolating them. This idea is a generalization of the traditional concept of self-calibration, where initial imaging of the target source supplies the visibility model for a re-solve of the gain calibration ($G$ or $T$). Iteration tends toward convergence to a statistically optimal image. In general, the quality of each calibration and of the source model are mutually dependent. In principle, as long as the solution for any calibration component (or the source model itself) is likely to improve substantially through the use of new information (provided by other improved solutions), it is worthwhile to continue this process.In practice, these concepts motivate certain patterns of calibration for different types of observation, and the **calibrater** tool in CASA is designed to accommodate these patterns in a general and flexible manner. For a spectral line total intensity observation, the pattern is usually:\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The MeasurementSet version 2 [[3](casa-fundamentals.ipynb#bibliography)], is a database designed to hold radioastronomical data to be calibrated following the MeasurementEquation approach by Hamaker, Bregman, and Sault (1996).\n",
        "\n",
        "Since its publication, the MeasurementSet (MS) design has been implemented by several software development groups, among them the CASA team and, e.g., the European VLBI Network team. CASA has also adopted the MeasurementEquation as its fundamental calibration scheme and has thus embraced the MS as its native way to store radio observations. With CASA becoming the designated analysis package for ALMA and the VLA, this means that the MS is now the default way of storing ALMA and VLA data during the actual analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The ALMA and VLA raw data format, however, is not the MS but the so-called ALMA Science Data Model (ASDM) for ALMA, and the Science Data Model (SDM) for the VLA. Both of which are closely related and are discussed in a separate section. The ALMA and VLA archives hence do not store data in MS format but in (A)SDM format, and when a CASA user starts to work with this data, the first step has to be the import of the (A)SDM into the CASA MS format.\n",
        "\n",
        "The MS is effectively a relational database which on the one hand tries to permit the storage of all imaginable radio (interferometric, single-dish) data with corresponding metadata, and on the other hand ventures to be storage-space and data-maintenance efficient by avoiding data redundancy.\n",
        "\n",
        "The universality is achieved by offering many optional parts in the format which cover most imaginable use cases in radio astronomy. So a simple, few-antenna interferometer observing a simple object with time-independent position at just a single frequency can store its data using a small sub-set of the format while a large interferometer with antennas on time-dependent locations, observing many objects in rapid succession with time-dependent source positions using a complex, time-dependent spectral setup etc., can equally use the MS to store its data albeit using a larger subset of the possibilities of the MS.\n",
        "\n",
        "The non-redundance of the format is achieved by simply following the standard approach of relational databases which is to put repeating pieces of information into separate database tables, the Subtables, and replacing them in the main body of the data base, the Main table, by references to the Subtables. In the case of the MS this happens in two layers of Subtables with the first layer being referenced by the Main table and the second layer being referenced by the first layer. I.e., there are some Subtables which reference other Subtables.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Subtable referencing mechanism is defined in the original design. It works either via the *line numbers* of the individual Subtable ,this implies that the reference is a zero-based integer and that the removal of a line in such a Subtable requires reindexing in the referencing table(s), or via explicit references to an index column in the Subtable ,the latter is much less common.\n",
        "\n",
        "These design principles lead to a format which puts the bulk of the data ,the interferometric visibilities and/or the single-dish total-power measurements with their timestamps, into a Main Table , and most of the metadata in the two layers of Subtables.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the CASA MS implementation, the individual Tables are all stored in the CASA Table format, i.e. they are actually not single files on disk but directories containing several files, essentially one for each column of the table. So the entire MS is also not a single file (like, e.g., in the FITS IDI format) but a whole directory tree. For transport, the MS typically has to be turned into a single file by using the command \\\"tar\\\".\n",
        "\n",
        "The Main Table contains the radio data initially in a column called *DATA* (interferometric data) or *FLOAT_DATA* (pure single-dish data). One of these two columns always has to be present.\n",
        "\n",
        "When a calibration is applied to the *DATA* column, a *CORRECTED_DATA* column is created to contain the calibrated data leaving the original data untouched. Furthermore, a *MODEL_DATA* column can be required to store expectation values for the emission of calibration sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "For large datasets these bulk data columns can require large amounts of disk space and access to them may be slow. To mitigate these problems, the CASA team is working on making the columns \\\"virtual\\\" as much as possible, i.e. replacing the *CORRECTED_DATA* and *MODEL_DATA* columns by parameterised versions calculated on-the-fly.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the case of the virtual *MODEL_DATA* column, this is essentially a model image which is stored with the MS and converted on-the-fly to visibilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the case of the virtual *CORRECTED_DATA* column, this is a so-called \\\"Cal Library\\\" which permits to calibrate the data in the *DATA* column on-the-fly and make the results available as if they were stored in a standard table column.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, a major case of data redundance for ALMA and VLA data is of course the fact that the raw data arrive at the user in (A)SDM format but then have to be translated into MS format which creates a completely redundant copy of all raw data without any gain for the user. This problem was addressed by introducing the so-called \\\"lazy\\\" import of (A)SDM data. The development is not yet completely finished but is already available for ALMA interferometric data. The idea here is to also make the *DATA* column virtual and perform the translation from the (A)SDM format on-the-fly. This typically shrinks the MS by a factor 30 in data volume. Of course the (A)SDM raw data has to be kept on disk for access. Access speeds to a virtual *DATA* column are essentially the same as to a non-virtual one. They may even be a little faster since the (A)SDM data is better compressed.\n",

These can be divided into two broad categories based on functionality: one processes multiple input MSs to produce a combined MS and one uses multiple MSs together as input for further processing such as imaging. For the former, **concat**, **virtualconcat**, and **testconcat** are available. For the latter, **tclean**, **sdintimging**, **tsdimaging**, and **sdimaging** are the tasks support such input. These tasks accept the vis parameter as a list of strings to point to each input MS. The levels of conformance of these input MSs needed to be in for these tasks so that they can handle properly vary among the tasks. The table summarizes required conformance among the input MS dataset. While providing more uniform behavior across CASA tasks in handling the multiple MS is still on-going effort, each task mentioned above calls a common helper function, **check_mslist** to check any differences in all the columns in the MS tables and the tasks will report users through warning or error messages in the log when incompatitiblity is encountered.
