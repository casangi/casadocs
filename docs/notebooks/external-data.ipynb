        "\n",
        "Each CASA distribution comes with a minimal repository of binary data that is required for CASA to function properly. This repository includes [Measures Tables](external-data.ipynb#The-casacore-Measures-tables \"Measures Tables\") that deal with the Earth Orientation Parameters (EOPs), reference frames, as well as ephemeris data. In particular the EOPs include predictions for the near future which drift until they are well determined. They are regularly updated in the CASA data repository at NRAO of which the user\\'s CASA installation contains a snapshot. Other data that is updated less frequently is also stored in the repository, such as beam models, antenna and Jy/K correction tables, and the antenna configuration files for the CASA simulator. Many tasks such as tclean, simobserve, and calibration tasks, need an up-to-date data repository to work properly. Because of this, the data repository of the CASA distribution must be updated occasionally as well.\n",

However, the data that underlies these updates is updated daily. If users need updates more frequently than weekly, it is possible to update the runtime data in place.
