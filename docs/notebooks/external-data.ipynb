        "Each CASA distribution comes with a minimal repository of binary data that is required for CASA to function properly. This repository includes [Measures Tables](external-data.ipynb#The-casacore-Measures-tables \"Measures Tables\") that deal with the Earth Orientation Parameters (EOPs), reference frames, as well as ephemeris data. In particular the EOPs include predictions for the near future which drift until they are well determined. They are regularly updated in the CASA data repository at NRAO of which the user\\'s CASA installation contains a snapshot. Because of this, the distribution data repository must be updated occasionally. Other data that is updated less frequently is also stored in the repository, such as beam models, antenna and Jy/K correction tables, and the antenna configuration files for the CASA simulator.\n",
