White-spaces before and after the commas (e.g. *'3C286, 3C48, 3C84'*) are ignored, while white-space within sub-strings is treated as part of the sub-string (e.g. *'3C286, VIRGO A, 3C84'*). In some cases, spaces need to be quoted, e.g. *\\\"'spw 1'\\\"* (note the double quote around the single quotes).\n",

Places where only integers make sense (e.g. IDs), if a floating point number is given, only the integer part is used (it is truncated). CASA 6 internally promotes integers to doubles, and for tasks CASA 6 ensures that the parameter values are converted to the internally acceptable type.\n",

For real numbers, it is used to select all values present for the appropriate parameter in the MeasurementSet between *N0* and *N1* (including the boundaries). Note that the `'~'` (tilde) character is used rather than the more obvious '*-*' in order to accommodate hyphens in strings and minus signs in numbers.\n",

        "String matching can be done in three ways. Any component of a comma separated list that cannot be parsed as a number, a number range, or a physical quantity is treated as a regular expression or a literal string. If the string does not contain the characters '\\*', '{', '}' or '?', it is treated as a literal string and used for exact matching. If any of the above mentioned characters are part of the string, they are used as a regular expression. As a result, for most cases, the user does not need to supply any special delimiters for literal strings and/or regular expressions. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",

        "However if it is required that the string be matched exclusively as a regular expression, it can be supplied within a pair of '/' as delimiters (e.g. '/.+BAND.+/'). A string enclosed within double quotes ('\\\"') is used exclusively for pattern matching (patterns are a simplified form of regular expressions - used in most UNIX commands for string matching). Patterns are internally converted to equivalent regular expressions before matching. See the Unix command \\\"info regex\\\", or visit [http://www.regular-expressions.info](http://www.regular-expressions.info), for details of regular expressions and patterns.\n",
