        "CARTA is the *Cube Analysis and Rendering Tool for Astronomy*, a new image visualization and analysis tool designed for the [ALMA](https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/), the [VLA](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla), and the [SKA pathfinders](https://www.skatelescope.org/). As image sizes continue to increase with modern telescopes, viewing an image with a local image viewer or with a remote image viewer via the ssh protocol becomes less efficient. The mission of CARTA is to provide usability and scalability for the future by utilizing modern web technologies and computing parallelization.\n",

        "\n",
        "The [CARTA Website](https://cartavis.github.io/) provides download links for CARTA on a variety of platforms and usage types.  CARTA is intended for more than just CASA usage and supports installation within large data warehouses and archives.  The specific usage mode relevant to most CASA users is running CARTA alongside a CASA instance to view the products produced by CASA.  The **Desktop version** of CARTA is intended for this purpose.\n",

        "If you are running CASA on your own laptop or workstation that you are directly using, then simply downloading and executing the *Desktop version* of CARTA for your OS is sufficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you are connecting to a workstation, cluster node, or any other machine via **ssh** or **VNC**, you will need to run the *Desktop version* of CARTA in *remote* mode.  This starts the CARTA backend and prints to the terminal a link that can be copied in to a web browser for connecting to the CARTA front end remotely.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following example illustrates how to run CARTA within NRAO from home:\n",

        "1. Connect home computer to the NRAO VPN and open a terminal\n",
        "2. (Optional) Reserve a cluster node in the [usual manner](https://info.nrao.edu/computing/guide/cluster-processing/access-and-running-jobs) \n",
        "3. `$ ssh <username>@your_cluster_node` or `$ ssh <username>@your_workstation` from your home computer\n",
        "4. `$ carta --remote`\n",

        "\n",

        "1. `$ ssh <username>@ssh.aoc.nrao.edu`\n",
