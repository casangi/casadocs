The fact that the CASA application environment is IPython based means that users can also use the IPython magic commands like `%run`. Users are encouraged to explore the options available with IPython, but this is outside the scope of this document. CASA only supports configuration using **config.py**. Some of these configuration variable in **config.py** are used to configure IPython at startup time. CASA configures IPython to supply parentheses when they are omitted. For example, when `sin 3` is executed IPython supplies the missing parens and invokes `sin(3)`. CASA also turns off any output that the paren expansion would normally generate.\n",

While casashell tasks (tasks run in the [CASA shell environment](../api/casashell.rst)) could be treated as scriptable in the Python 2.7/CASA 5 version of *execfile*, in Python 3/CASA 6 this behavior is not supported. Python replacements for *execfile* exist [i.e., \"%run -i\" or \"exec(open(read...\"] which provide some scripting capabilities for casashell commands, though these Python alternatives are not tested in any internal CASA regression tests.\n",

        "### CASA 6 - casashell (monolithic) version of tasks\n",
        "When starting CASA in its full installation variant, using the `bin/casa` command, a version of the CASA tasks meant for interactive use in the CASA IPython prompt is automatically imported. These interactive or casashell versions of the CASA tasks ([see casashell](../api/casashell.rst)) support, for example, the inp/go commands. The behavior of these casashell tasks in terms of error handling is intentionally different from the behavior of the modular version of the tasks, as explained below.\n",

        "### Standardized behavior since CASA 6.2\n",
        "\n",
        "The behavior of tasks with respect to errors, exceptions, and return values in case of error has been standardized since CASA 6.2. In CASA 6.x, this standardization applies only to CASA tasks when imported `from casatasks`. The casashell versions that come with casashell (CASA IPython prompt) keep the same behavior: they never throw exceptions and instead return False in case of a serious error (exception in the task). This is ensured by the casashell infrastructure (casashell task wrappers) that will never let an exception out.\n",
        "\n",
        "The changes introduced are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* All tasks throw exceptions as normal Python functions (the one or more top level try/except blocks that would trap all exceptions in 1/3+ of tasks have been removed or replaced in favor of finally blocks that clean up tools, etc. resources, see [documentation on Python clean-up actions and the finally clause](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#defining-clean-up-actions).\n",
        "* Exception types are more specific, using different Python built-in exceptions and avoiding the overly generic 'Exception' type as much as possible.\n",
        "* The message when there is an exception in a task is the same for all tasks, is printed to the CASA log and reads, for example, like this:\n",
        "    \"Task &lt;mstransform&gt; raised an exception of class &lt;RuntimeError&gt; with the following message: Desired column (CORRECTED_DATA) not found in the input MS (/casadata/uid___X02_X3d737_X1_01_small.ms)\"\n",
        "* The same behavior when there are errors in HISTORY updates is ensured across all CASA tasks: produce a warning message but don't change the task return/exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The situation before/after these changes can be summarized as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "* In CASA releases earlier than 6.2/5.8, some tasks would raise exceptions, but other tasks would never raise exceptions. Instead, they would trap any exceptions raised in the task and return different values representing unsuccessful execution, such as False, None, or {}. To know whether exceptions were raised or something else returned (and what particular something else was returned), one would need to look into the task code, as this was undocumented behavior and there was no clear pattern to explain the different behavior of different tasks.\n",
        "* Beginning in CASA 6.2, all CASA tasks raise exceptions in the event of an unrecoverable error, as they would be raised by normal Python functions. Client code using CASA tasks can assume all tasks raise exceptions in case of error and devise a consistent error handling approach when using CASA tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following list summarizes the tasks which will raise exceptions after CASA 6.2/5.8 but did not raise exceptions in earlier versions of CASA:\n",
        "\n",
        "* from casatasks: clearcal, clearstat, cvel2, delmod, fixplanets, fixvis, flagdata, hanningsmooth, imhead, importasdm, importatca, importgmrt, importmiriad, importuvfits, imregrid, imsmooth, initweights, listcal, listfits, listhistory, listobs, listpartition, listvis, mstransform, nrobeamaverage, partition, plotants, sdpolaverage, sdtimeaverage, setjy, specfit, split, spxfit, uvsub, vishead\n",
        "* from casaplotms: plotms\n",
        "\n",
        "The impact on scripts that use these tasks is that errors will now be more visible, with an exception raised rather than a probably silent and ambiguous `False` or `None` or `{}` return.\n",
        "Note that scripts that do not import tasks explicitly `from casatasks` are implicitly using the casashell version of the tasks. These scripts would not see any behavior changes, as in their case the casashell tasks never throw exceptions.\n",
        "In scripts that use tasks `from casatasks` and were not checking the return value of tasks (for example for a `False` or `{}` value), potential failures in tasks would remain potentially hidden in the code flow, before CASA 6.2/5.8 (and maybe unnoticed). From CASA 6.2/5.8 onward, a failure in a task will raise an exception. Scripts can implement error handling to react to exceptions from tasks by using the `try` clause of Python.\n"
