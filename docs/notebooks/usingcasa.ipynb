This allows simple installation and import in to standard Python 3.6 environments. The casatools wheel is necessarily a binary wheel so there may be some compatibility issues for some time as we work toward making wheels available for important Python configurations. Initially, we are targeting Python 3.6 as provided by RedHat for our wheel production, with RH6 and RH7 as official supported platforms. We have had some success on other Linux-based platforms as well, but we do not recommend the use of Conda until compatibility with Conda is better understood. The modular pip-wheel version is also available for Mac OSX, but has not yet been as extensively tested as the Mac OS tarfile distribution or modular Linux RedHat version.\n",

        "\n",
        "The behavior of tasks with respect to errors, exceptions, and return values in case of error has been standardized in CASA 6.2/5.8. In CASA 6.x, this standardization applies only to CASA tasks when imported `from casatasks`. The casashell versions that come with casashell (CASA IPython prompt) keep the same behavior: they never throw exceptions and instead return False in case of a serious error (exception in the task). This is ensured by the casashell infrastructure (casashell task wrappers) that will never let an exception out. In CASA 5.x, the standardization applies when one sets `__rethrow_casa_exceptions=True`. If `__rethrow_casa_exceptions=False`, exceptions are never thrown, they are captured by the CASA 5 task infrastructure, and an error message is printed to the log.\n",
        "\n",
        "The changes introduced are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* All tasks throw exceptions as normal Python functions (the one or more top level try/except blocks that would trap all exceptions in 1/3+ of tasks have been removed or replaced in favor of finally blocks that clean up tools, etc. resources, see [documentation on Python clean-up actions and the finally clause](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#defining-clean-up-actions).\n",
        "* Exception types are more specific, using different Python built-in exceptions and avoiding the overly generic 'Exception' type as much as possible.\n",
        "* The message when there is an exception in a task is the same for all tasks, is printed to the CASA log and reads, for example, like this:\n",
        "    \"Task &lt;mstransform&gt; raised an exception of class &lt;RuntimeError&gt; with the following message: Desired column (CORRECTED_DATA) not found in the input MS (/casadata/uid___X02_X3d737_X1_01_small.ms)\"\n",
        "* The same behavior when there are errors in HISTORY updates is ensured across all CASA tasks: produce a warning message but don't change the task return/exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The situation before/after these changes can be summarized as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "* In CASA releases earlier than 6.2/5.8, some tasks would raise exceptions, but other tasks would never raise exceptions. Instead, they would trap any exceptions raised in the task and return different values representing unsuccessful execution, such as False, None, or {}. To know whether exceptions were raised or something else returned (and what particular something else was returned), one would need to look into the task code, as this was undocumented behavior and there was no clear pattern to explain the different behavior of different tasks.\n",
        "* Beginning in CASA 5.8/6.2, all CASA tasks raise exceptions in the event of an unrecoverable error, as they would be raised by normal Python functions. Client code using CASA tasks can assume all tasks raise exceptions in case of error and devise a consistent error handling approach when using CASA tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following list summarizes the tasks which will raise exceptions after CASA 6.2/5.8 but did not raise exceptions in earlier versions of CASA:\n",
        "\n",
        "* from casatasks: clearcal, clearstat, cvel2, delmod, fixplanets, fixvis, flagdata, hanningsmooth, imhead, importasdm, importatca, importgmrt, importmiriad, importuvfits, imregrid, imsmooth, initweights, listcal, listfits, listhistory, listobs, listpartition, listvis, mstransform, nrobeamaverage, partition, plotants, sdpolaverage, sdtimeaverage, setjy, specfit, split, spxfit, uvsub, vishead\n",
        "* from casaplotms: plotms\n",
        "\n",
        "The impact on scripts that use these tasks is that errors will now be more visible, with an exception raised rather than a probably silent and ambiguous `False` or `None` or `{}` return. \n",
        "Note that scripts that do not import tasks explicitly `from casatasks` are implicitly using the casashell version of the tasks. These scripts would not see any behavior changes, as in their case the casashell tasks never throw exceptions.\n",
        "In scripts that use tasks `from casatasks` and were not checking the return value of tasks (for example for a `False` or `{}` value), potential failures in tasks would remain potentially hidden in the code flow, before CASA 6.2/5.8 (and maybe unnoticed). From CASA 6.2/5.8 onward, a failure in a task will raise an exception. Scripts can implement error handling to react to exceptions from tasks by using the `try` clause of Python. \n"

The full range of offerings from Amazon goes well beyond that simple conceptual model but many, if not most, are not directly applicable to radio astronomy data processing.\n",

AWS fills spot requests starting at the highest bid and working down to the lowest, the bid price paid by all spot users is the bid price reached when all resources were exhausted.  When you request a spot instance you submit a bid for those resources.  If that bid exceeds the current spot price, then the spot instance will launch and continue to run as long as the spot price remains below the bid. Typically, the spot price is much less than the on-demand price, so bidding the on-demand price typically permits an instance to run its job to completion. During the time it runs, it is billed only at the running spot price, not the bid, so the savings can be considerable.  If the spot price rises above your bid your instance will be terminated.  Be warned, if demand is excessive for that particular instance type and you bid 2x or more of the on-demand price you run the risk of the spot price rising to that level.  Over bidding the demand price is most useful for very long running jobs where it\\'s considered acceptable to pay more for brief periods while minimizing the risk that the instance will be terminated due to a low bid.\n",

A 10-hour run of 100 instances would have cost \\$239 for on-demand and \\$34 for spot instances. That assumes adding 100 instances to the spot market will not affect the spot price much, which is a reasonable assumption. However, adding 500 instances will certainly raise the spot price.\n",

        "There are over 40 instance types with varying amounts of RAM and CPUs. There are, when you look closely, many storage options, but a few recurrent themes emerge. The simple storage system (S3) is primarily for storing large volumes of data from a few hours to a few months. S3 can be used to stage input and output data. You can share these data with other users. EBS storage is the most often used \\\"attached\\\" storage with performance comparable to a very good hard drive attached to your desktop system. However, it\\'s bandwidth goes up with the core count, contrary to ordinary storage. The number of cores and GBs of RAM depend entirely on instance type. If you were to want 4 GB RAM per core (as recommended in CASA [Hardware Requirements](usingcasa.ipynb#hardware-requirements)) and 10 cores, you can find the closest instance on the list of instance types, <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/>. m4.4xlarge is close with 16 \\\"vCPU\\\" and 64 GB. Despite apearances, it does not have enough cores. AWS lists \\\"vCPUs\\\" (a.k.a. hyperthread) instead of cores. A vCPU is an internal CPU scheduling trick that is useful for certain classes of programs, but is nearly always detrimental in scientific computing, e.g., CASA. To summarize, 2 Amazon vCPUs equal 1 core. From here on cores are used, where 1 core = 2 vCPUs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Continuing with the example of looking for an instance that meets the contraints of 10 cores and 4 GB RAM per core, it makes sense to look at core count first. The listing of instances with their core count, memory, and cost are here: <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/>. There are no instances with 10 cores. The closest have 8 and 16 cores. So we\\'ll look at \\>=16 core instances. Also, we\\'ll throw out any instances that do not have: RAM \\>= (\\#cores \\* 4 GB RAM). What is left (without looking at immensely large and therefore expensive instances) are these:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   m4.10xlarge with 20 cores and 160 GB of RAM. Cost: \\$2.394/hour\n",
        "-   x1.32xlarge with 64 cores and 1962 GB of RAM. Cost: \\$13.338/hour\n",
        "-   r3.8xlarge with 16 cores and 244 GB of RAM. Cost: \\$2.66/hour\n",
        "-   d2.8xlarge with 18 cores and 244 GB of RAM. Cost: \\$5.52/hour\n",
        "\n",
        "Selecting 10 cores produced a results list that contains the most expensive instances. If it\\'s feasible to use a number of cores that is an exponent of 2, a more efficient arrangement may result.  Looking at what instances with 2\\^3 = 8 cores also meet the criterion of 4GB RAM per core, for example:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   m4.4xlarge 8 cores, 64 GB RAM. Cost: \\$0.958/hour\n",
        "-   c3.8xlarge 8 cores, 60 GB RAM. Cost: \\$1.68/hour (instance store)\n",
        "\n",
        "The c3.8xlarge, although very similar to the m4.4xlarge, costs 75% more per hour. That\\'s because c3.8xlarge comes pre-configured with local (instance store) storage. This is charged even when it is not used. It is something to watch out for. Instance store can be useful, but it is tricky to make use of. The use of instance store is outside the scope of this document. When considering 8 core instances, m4.4xlarge appears to be the most attractive option in this case.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   m4.4xlarge 8 cores 4 GB/core \\$0.958/hour\n",
        "-   r3.8xlarge 16 cores \\~15 GB/core \\$2.66/hour\n",
        "-   r3.4xlarge 8 cores \\~7.6 GB/core \\$1.33/hour\n",
        "\n",
        "r3.4xlarge is not far behind in price. And it has more RAM as well as 320 GB of instance store storage. So zeroing in on the best instance takes some time. However, it is not time well spent to find the most efficient instance until many instances are to be run or an instance is run for a long period of time.\n",

        "\n",
        "So, to begin, it is probably best to choose EC2 as your primary storage, S3 for cold storage, and an instance with \\>=4GB RAM per core. A more detailed discussion of these (and other) hardware considerations is outlined in the  [Hardware Requirements](usingcasa.ipynb#hardware-requirements) page.  What is covered here is what is sufficient to get started. Keep in mind that, since AWS has hyperthreading turned on, their \\\"2 cores\\\" means \\\"1 physical core\\\" (2 hyperthreads). For example, an AWS \\\"8 core\\\" instance type is actually only 4 physical cores. CASA does not make good use of virtual cores so if you want a system with 4 actual cores, select an AWS \\\"8 core\\\" system with \\>= 16 GB of RAM. That should be sufficent to get started. As you use AWS more, you\\'ll want to invest more time in optimizing the instance type based on the details of your processing case. If you are running only a few instances, such optimizations are not worth much effort, but if you plan to run hundreds of jobs, this can have a very significant impact on total run time and cost. The 4GB per physical core rule should be sufficient to get started, but more demanding imaging tasks will likely require 8GB or 16Gbyte per core.\n",
