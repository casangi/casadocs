The 'Beta 1' functionality has been validated and the [installation instructions](https://github.com/casangi/casagui/wiki/Interactive-Clean#startup) on the wiki are confirmed to work with CASA 6.6.4 and later releases.  The installation instructions describe how to install, import and run the iclean function, which provides a GUI for mask drawing and iteration control and calls the tclean and deconvolve tasks behind the scenes.  Although the iclean project is not yet officially released, we welcome feedback from users at casa-feedback@nrao.edu.\n",

Depending on your specific architecture and OS version, other solutions may include: running interactive tclean from an older version of CASA, running the Linux build of CASA on a virtual machine or using a remote Linux machine. Users could also consider running tclean in a pseudo-interactive mode where the initial images are produced by tclean with *interactive=False* and *niter=0*, masks are drawn in CARTA and saved as region files, then tclean is provided these regions via the mask parameter and re-started with *niter* > 0.\n"
