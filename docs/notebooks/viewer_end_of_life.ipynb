Users could also consider running tclean in a pseudo-interactive mode where the initial images are produced by tclean with *interactive=False* and *niter=0*, masks are drawn in CARTA and saved as region files, then tclean is provided these regions via the mask parameter and re-started with *niter* > 0.\n"
