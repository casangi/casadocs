                                            input MSes
 


antenna
---------------------------------------

:code:`''`

Select data based on antenna/baseline

                   default: '' (all)
                   If antenna string is a non-negative integer, it is
 		   assumed to be an antenna index, otherwise, it is
 		   considered an antenna name.
                   antenna='5\&6'; baseline between antenna index 5 and
 				 index 6.
                   antenna='VA05\&VA06'; baseline between VLA antenna 5

scan
---------------------------------------

:code:`''`

Scan number range

                   default: '' (all)
                   example: scan='1~5'
                   For multiple MS input, a list of scan strings can be used:
                   scan=['0~100','10~200']
                   scan='0~100; scan ids 0-100 for all input MSes




observation
---------------------------------------

:code:`''`

Observation ID range
                   default: '' (all)
                   example: observation='1~5'



imsize
---------------------------------------

:code:`numpy.array( [  ] )`

Number of pixels
         example :  imsize = [350,250]
                           imsize = 500 is equivalent to [500,500]
         To take proper advantage of internal optimized FFT routines, the
         number of pixels must be even and factorizable by 2,3,5,7 only.



cell
---------------------------------------

:code:`numpy.array( [  ] )`

Cell size
               example: cell=['0.5arcsec,'0.5arcsec'] or
               cell=['1arcmin', '1arcmin']
               cell = '1arcsec' is equivalent to ['1arcsec','1arcsec']



stokes
---------------------------------------

:code:`'I'`

Stokes Planes to make (I only, for now)
               default='I'; example: stokes='IQUV';
                 Options: 'I','Q','U','V','IV','QU','IQ','UV','IQUV','RR','LL','XX','YY','RRLL','XXYY','pseudoI'

                             Note : Due to current internal code constraints, if any correlation pair
                                        is flagged, by default, no data for that row in the MS will be used.
                                        So, in an MS with XX,YY, if only YY is flagged, neither a
                                        Stokes I image nor an XX image can be made from those data points.
                                        In such a situation, please split out only the unflagged correlation into
                                        a separate MS.

                             Note : The 'pseudoI' option is a partial solution, allowing Stokes I imaging
                                    when either of the parallel-hand correlations are unflagged.

                             The remaining constraints shall be removed (where logical) in a future release.




specmode
---------------------------------------

:code:`'mfs'`

Spectral definition mode (mfs only, for now)

                       mode='mfs' : Continuum imaging with only one output image channel.
                                             (mode='cont' can also be used here)

                       mode='cube' : Spectral line imaging with one or more channels
                                               Parameters start, width,and nchan define the spectral
                                               coordinate system and can be specified either in terms
                                               of channel numbers, frequency or velocity in whatever
                                               spectral frame is specified in 'outframe'.
                                               All internal and output images are made with outframe as the
                                               base spectral frame. However imaging code internally uses the fixed
                                               spectral frame, LSRK for automatic internal software
                                               Doppler tracking so that a spectral line observed over an
                                               extended time range will line up appropriately.
                                               Therefore the output images have additional spectral frame conversion
                                               layer in LSRK on the top the base frame.


                                               (Note : Even if the input parameters are specified in a frame
                                                           other than LSRK, the viewer still displays spectral
                                                           axis in LSRK by default because of the conversion frame
                                                           layer mentioned above. The viewer can be used to relabel
                                                           the spectral axis in any desired frame - via the spectral
                                                           reference option under axis label properties in the
                                                           data display options window.)


                                               

                        mode='cubedata' : Spectral line imaging with one or more channels
                                                        There is no internal software Doppler tracking so
                                                        a spectral line observed over an extended time range
                                                        may be smeared out in frequency. There is strictly
                                                        no valid spectral frame with which to label the output
                                                        images, but they will list the frame defined in the MS.





weighting
---------------------------------------

:code:`'natural'`

Weighting scheme (natural,uniform,briggs,superuniform,radial)

                       During gridding of the dirty or residual image, each visibility value is
                       multiplied by a weight before it is accumulated on the uv-grid.
                       The PSF's uv-grid is generated by gridding only the weights (weightgrid).

                       weighting='natural' : Gridding weights are identical to the data weights
                                                         from the MS. For visibilities with similar data weights,
                                                         the weightgrid will follow the sample density
                                                         pattern on the uv-plane. This weighting scheme
                                                         provides the maximum imaging sensitivity at the
                                                         expense of a possibly fat PSF with high sidelobes.
                                                         It is most appropriate for detection experiments
                                                         where sensitivity is most important.

                       weighting='uniform' : Gridding weights per visibility data point are the
                                                          original data weights divided by the total weight of
                                                          all data points that map to the same uv grid cell :
                                                          ' data_weight / total_wt_per_cell '.

                                                          The weightgrid is as close to flat as possible resulting
                                                          in a PSF with a narrow main lobe and suppressed
                                                          sidelobes. However, since heavily sampled areas of
                                                          the uv-plane get down-weighted, the imaging
                                                          sensitivity is not as high as with natural weighting.
                                                          It is most appropriate for imaging experiments where
                                                          a well behaved PSF can help the reconstruction.

                       weighting='briggs' :  Gridding weights per visibility data point are given by
                                                         'data_weight / ( A / total_wt_per_cell + B ) ' where
                                                         A and B vary according to the 'robust' parameter.

                                                         robust = -2.0 maps to A=1,B=0 or uniform weighting.
                                                         robust = +2.0 maps to natural weighting.
                                                         (robust=0.5 is equivalent to robust=0.0 in AIPS IMAGR.)

                                                         Robust/Briggs weighting generates a PSF that can
                                                         vary smoothly between 'natural' and 'uniform' and
                                                         allow customized trade-offs between PSF shape and
                                                         imaging sensitivity.

                       weighting='superuniform' : This is similar to uniform weighting except that
                                                                    the total_wt_per_cell is replaced by the
                                                                    total_wt_within_NxN_cells around the uv cell of
                                                                    interest.  ( N = subparameter 'npixels' )

                                                                   This method tends to give a PSF with inner
                                                                   sidelobes that are suppressed as in uniform
                                                                   weighting but with far-out sidelobes closer to
                                                                   natural weighting. The peak sensitivity is also
                                                                   closer to natural weighting.

                       weighting='radial' : Gridding weights are given by ' data_weight * uvdistance '

                                                      This method approximately minimizes rms sidelobes
                                                      for an east-west synthesis array.

robust
---------------------------------------

:code:`float(0.5)`

Robustness parameter for Briggs weighting.

                            robust = -2.0 maps to uniform weighting.
                            robust = +2.0 maps to natural weighting.
                            (robust=0.5 is equivalent to robust=0.0 in AIPS IMAGR.)




npixels
---------------------------------------

:code:`int(0)`

Number of pixels to determine uv-cell size for super-uniform weighting
                      (0 defaults to -/+ 3 pixels)

                     npixels -- uv-box used for weight calculation
                                    a box going from -npixel/2 to +npixel/2 on each side
                                   around a point is used to calculate weight density.

                     npixels=2 goes from -1 to +1 and covers 3 pixels on a side.

                     npixels=0 implies a single pixel, which does not make sense for
                                     superuniform weighting. Therefore, if npixels=0 it will
                                     be forced to 6 (or a box of -3pixels to +3pixels) to cover
                                     7 pixels on a side.




uvtaper
---------------------------------------

:code:`numpy.array( [ '' ] )`

uv-taper on outer baselines in uv-plane

                   Apply a Gaussian taper in addition to the weighting scheme specified
                   via the 'weighting' parameter. Higher spatial frequencies are weighted
                   down relative to lower spatial frequencies to suppress artifacts
                   arising from poorly sampled areas of the uv-plane. It is equivalent to
                   smoothing the PSF obtained by other weighting schemes and can be
                   specified either as a Gaussian in uv-space (eg. units of lambda)
                   or as a Gaussian in the image domain (eg. angular units like arcsec).

                   uvtaper = [bmaj, bmin, bpa]

                   NOTE: the on-sky FWHM in arcsec is roughly  the uv taper/200 (klambda).
                   default: uvtaper=[]; no Gaussian taper applied
 		   example: uvtaper=['5klambda']  circular taper
 				FWHM=5 kilo-lambda
                            uvtaper=['5klambda','3klambda','45.0deg']
                            uvtaper=['10arcsec'] on-sky FWHM 10 arcseconds
                            uvtaper=['300.0'] default units are lambda
 			        in aperture plane
