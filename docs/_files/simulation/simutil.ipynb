    "\n",
    "**simutil** contains numerous utility methods which can assist users in generic ephemeris and geodesy calculations to aid in performing simulations and other activities in CASA, as well as some methods used internally by **simobserve** and **simanalyze**. Several of these tasks directly call the **simulator** tool in an attempt to lessen the amount of scripting required and to make it easier for the user. It is used by import and instantiation, similarly to testhelper and recipes:\n",
