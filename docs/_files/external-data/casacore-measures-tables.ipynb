    "The casacore infrastructure includes classes to handle physical quantities with a reference frame, so-called \\\"Measures\\\". Each type of Measure has its own distinct class in casacore which is derived from the Measure base class. One of the main functionalilties provided by casacore w.r.t. Measures, is the conversion of Measures from one reference frame to another using the MeasConvert classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the spectral, spatial, and time reference frames are time-dependent and require the knowledge of the outcome of ongoing monitoring measurements of properties of the Earth and astronomical objects by certain service observatories. This data is tabulated in a number of tables (*\\\"Measures Tables\\\"*) which are stored in the CASA data repository in the subdirectory *\\\"geodetic\\\"*. A snapshot of this repository is included in each tarball distribution of CASA and in the casadata module for CASA6+. It can be updated to the latest status as described [here](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/external-data/casa-data-repository).\n",
    "\n",
    "The CASA data repository is updated daily based on the daily refinement of the geodetic information from the relevant services like the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS). Strictly speaking, the Measures tables are part of the casacore infrastructure which is developed by NRAO, ESO, NAOJ, CSIRO, and ASTRON. In order to keep the repository consistent between the partners, the Measures tables are initially created at a single institution (ASTRON) and then copied into the NRAO CASA data repository from where all CASA users can retrieve them. As of March 2020, the update of the NRAO CASA copy of the Measures tables in \\\"geodetic\\\" and the planetary ephemerides in directory \\\"ephemerides\\\" takes place every day between 18 h UTC and 19 h UTC via two redundant servers at ESO (Garching).\n",
