\noindent{\bf Regions and the Regionmanager}

When working with an image, one is generally interested in some part of
that image on which astrophysical analysis is performed.  This \region\
(or more generically and simply, the `region') might be the whole image,
or some subset of it. 

Regions come in a few varieties.  There are simple regular shapes (box,
ellipsoid), simple irregular shapes (polygon), as well as compound
regions made by combining other regions (simple or compound).  For
example unions or intersections of regions.  In addition, the simple
regions can be pixel-coordinate based or world-coordinate based. 
However, a compound regions must always comprise world-coordinate based
regions. 

It is the task of the \regionmanager\ (\tool) to manage your regions; it
creates, lists and manipulates them.  Apart from a \regionmanager, the
only other way to create a \region\ is with the
<link anchor="">viewier</link> \tool (type viewer within the
casapy environment).  This
allows you to interactively make, with the cursor and an image display,
a box or polygonal region.  The region so made may be collected by the
\regionmanager\ (in fact the complete process can be initiated from the
\regionmanager). 

The \regionmanager\ has a command line interface, but there are plans
to have it interact directly with the 
<link anchor="">CASA viewer</link>\tool. in the future.
Currently the only way to interact is to save the regions created
with the viewer to a file or as a region in the image , and use the \regionmanager\ function
fromfiletorecord or fromtabletorecord, repsectively, to bring the regions in the CLI.

It is probably fair to say that for the simplest regions, such as a 
pixel box, there is little to choose between making a region with the  
GUI or the command line interface.  However, for the world regions, 
the GUI is significantly better; it hides the details of handling the 
coordinate information.  

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf Simple Pixel and World regions}

Pixel regions are specified purely in terms of pixel coordinates.  Pixel
coordinates are considered to run from 1 at the bottom left corner 
(blc) of an image to the image shape at the top-right corner (trc).

For example, a pixel region might be box that runs from a bottom
blc of [20,20] to a trc of [64,90] in a 2D image.  Such a pixel region
is NOT very portable though.  If you are interested in a region about an
astronomical source, pixel coordinates are only useful for a particular
image.  In some other image, the source may well have different pixel
coordinates.  However, pixel regions are easy to make and use, and they
are valuable. 

So far, we have been talking about absolute pixel coordinates.  However,
pixel regions can also be specified in relative coordinates.  This is
controlled through the argument  {\stfaf absrel} which may take on one
of the values 'abs' (absolute coordinates) 'relref' (relative to the
reference pixel of the image) or 'relcen' (relative to the center of the
image).  You can use the <link anchor="images:image.summary.function">summary</link> function
of the <link anchor="images:image">image</link> module to see the reference pixel. 
The sense of the offset is  $rel = abs - ref$.

You may also define pixel regions in terms of fractional coordinates
that are in the range [0,1] (blc to trc) - look for argument {\stfaf frac}
which can be T or F.

<example>

From the command line, let's make a simple pixel box region with



- ia.open('myimage')
- csys = ia.coordsys()
- r1 = rg.box( blc=[10,20], trc=[30,40] )
- ia.statistics(region=r1);
Number points = 441           
Flux density  = -1.728895e-03  Jy
Sum           = -9.522969e-02        Mean     = -2.159403e-04 
Variance      = 1.518106e-05         Sigma    = 3.896288e-03  
Rms           = 3.897854e-03  

Minimum value is -1.208747e-02  at [13, 32]
Maximum value is 1.287862e-02   at [21, 37]


You have now created a region tool called {\stf r1} which describes a 2D
box from [10,20] to [30,40] in absolute pixel coordinates.   The region
is made `const' as well so you can't overwrite it by mistake.  
We then apply it to an image and evaluate some statistics in the
specified region.

</example>

World regions are more portable, because the region is specified in
terms of the world coordinates (e.g.  RA and DEC, or Frequency etc). 
You can create a region with one image, and then apply it to another. 
For example, you might make an RA/DEC world box (i.e.  blc and trc
specified as RA and DEC) from an optical image.  You can then apply it
to your radio image of the same source.  The software will look for the
axes of the region (in this case RA and DEC), and then attempt to match
them with the image to which the region is being applied.  For each
matching axis, the region will be applied.  

When you make a world region, you must supply a coordinate system from
the appropriate image to the \regionmanager.  The coordinate system
comes from the <link anchor="images:image.coordsys.function">coordsys</link> function
of the Image tool.  This associates a coordinate with an image pixel
axis. 

<example>

Now let's do an example with a world box.  It is better to make a world
box with the GUI interface, but the command line is still manageable. 
First, let's summarise the header of our image (the one from the
previous example). 


- ia.open( 'myimage' )
- ia.summary()
Image name       : myimage
Image mask       : Absent
Image units      : JY/BEAM

Direction system : J2000

Name             Proj Shape Tile   Coord value at pixel    Coord incr Units
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Right Ascension   SIN   155  155  17:42:29.303    90.00 -1.000000e+00 arcsec
Declination       SIN   178  178 -28.59.18.600    90.00  1.000000e+00 arcsec
T


And now we will make a world box with the blc at the reference pixel,
and the trc offset somewhat.  We use the <link anchor="quanta:quanta">quanta</link>
module for creating associations of values and units; in particular,
the <link anchor="quanta:quanta.quantity.function">quantity</link> function.


- blc = "17:42:29.303 -28.59.18.600";
- trc = "17:42:28.303 -28.59.10.600";
- csys = ia.coordsys()
- r2 = rg.wbox(blc=blc, trc=trc, pixelaxes=[0,1], csys=csys.torecord() )
- ia.boundingbox(r2);
[blc=[90 90], trc=[103 98], inc=[1 1], bbShape=[14 9], regionShape=[14 9], imageShape=[155 178] ]


As well as passing in the blc and trc quantities, we have also told the
\regionmanager\ which axes these values pertain to (they are numbered in
the order in which they list in the {\cf summary} function), and we
also supplied it with the coordinate system of the image.  Note that
with the GUI interface, both the axes and coordinates handling is
hidden.  If we wished, we could have left out the {\stfaf pixelaxes}
argument, and it would have defaulted to [0,1].   We then find
the bounding box of the region when it's applied to the image.
You can see from the summary listing that it is correct.

</example>

We generally think about our images as being in some order;
RA/DEC/Frequency (for the X/Y/Z axes) or whatever.  In the application
of world regions, this order is unimportant.  If you created a world
region from an RA/DEC/Frequency image, and applied it to a
Frequency/DEC/RA image, that image order change would be accounted for. 

Note that for pixel regions however, because the region is not tagged
with a coordinate system, the order of the image is relevant.  So if you
made a pixel box from an RA/DEC image and applied it to a DEC/RA image,
the RA range would be applied to the DEC axis and vice versa.  The pixel
regions are present for simple usage only. 

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf Simple pixel regions as world regions}

It is possible to create a world region that is specified in pixel
coordinates, and maintains the coordinate axis information.  This can be
useful because compound regions must be world-coordinate based (see
below).  We can do this because we have defined in the \regionmanager,
``new'' world units, called ``pix'' (which are then known to the
<link anchor="quanta:quanta">quanta</link> module) and these are recognized in the
world regions.  Similarly, we have also defined a unit called ``frac''. 
This allows you to specify world coordinates in units of the fraction of
the image shape.  For example, the blc of a 2D image has a ``frac''
coordinate of [0,0] and a trc of [1,1].  But be careful, such regions
are still not portable to another image, because they are still
effectively pixel-coordinate based (although masquerading as world
regions). 

<example>

- ia.maketestimage()
- csys = ia.coordsys()
-
- r1 = rg.wbox(blc="10pix,10pix", trc="20pix,20pix", pixelaxes=[0,1], csys=csys.torecord())
- localstats = ia.statistics(region=r1, list=False, verbose=False)
- print 'Region 1: number points = ', localstats['npts'][0]
Region 1: number points =  121
-
- r2 = rg.wbox(blc="30pix 30pix", trc="40pix 40pix", pixelaxes=[0,1], csys=csys.torecord())  
- localstats=ia.statistics(region=r2, list=False, verbose=False)
- print 'Region 2: number points = ', localstats['npts'][0]
Region 2: number points =  121

- regions={}
- regions['r1']=[r1]
- regions['r2']=[r2]
- r3 = rg.makeunion(regions)
- localstats=ia.statistics(region=r3, list=False, verbose=False)
- print 'Region 3: number points = ', localstats['npts'][0]
Region 3: number points =  242

In this example we make a union from two pixel boxes masquerading as
world regions.  
</example>

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf Compound Regions}

It is often desirable to make a region which combines others.  These are
called compound regions.  For example, give me the union of 3 regions
and evaluate the statistics in that union.  Or intersect this region
with that one and extract the image data from that region.  Compound
regions are fully recursive; you can nest them as deeply as you like. 

You {\em must} be aware that compound regions can only be made from
world-coordinated based regions.  You can convert a pixel region to a
world region with the
<link anchor="images:regionmanager.pixeltoworldregion.function">pixeltoworldregion</link>
function (at some point this function will move from the \regionmanager\
\tool\ to the <link anchor="images:image">Image</link> \tool. 

<example>

- ia.open('myimage')
- csys ia.coordsys();
-
- blc = "17:42:29.303, -28.59.18.600";
- trc = "17:42:28.303, -28.59.10.600";
- r1 = rg.wbox(blc=blc,trc=trc,pixelaxes=[0,1],csys=csys.torecord());
- ia.boundingbox(r1);
[blc=[90 90] , trc=[103 98] , inc=[1 1], bbShape=[14 9] , regionShape=[14 9] , imageShape=[155 178] ] 
-
- blc = "17:42:27.303, -28.59.18.600"
- trc = "17:42:26.303, -28.59.10.600"
- r2 = rg.wbox(blc=blc,trc=trc,pixelaxes=[0,1],csys=csys.torecord());
- ia.boundingbox(r2);
[blc=[116 90] , trc=[129 98] , inc=[1 1], bbShape=[14 9] , regionShape=[14 9] , imageShape=[155 178] ] 
-
- regions={}
- regions['r1']=[r1]
- regions['r2']=[r2]
- r3 = rg.makeunion(regions)
- bb = ia.boundingbox(r3)
- bb
[blc=[90 90] , trc=[129 98] , regionShape=[40 9] , imageShape=[155 178] ] 
- 
- s1 = ia.statistics(region=r1, list=False)
- s2 = ia.statistics(region=r2, list=False)
- s3 = ia.statistics(region=r3, list=False)
-
- np = (bb['trc'][0]-bb['blc'][0]+1)*(bb['trc'][1]-bb['blc'][1]+1)
- print 'No. pts in r1, r2, r3, bb(r3) = ', s1['npts'][0], s2['npts'][0], s3['npts'][0], np
No. pts in r1, r2, r3, bb(r3) =  126, 126, 252, 360
-
-
- r4 = rg.intersection(r1, r2)
- ia.boundingbox(r4)
- r4
{}



We make two world boxes and find the bounding box of each.  Then
we make the union of the two and find the bounding box which we store in
a record called {\cf bb}.  We then find some statistics over the union
(supressing the logger output and storing the results in records).
You can see that the number of points found in the region reflects the
union, not the bounding box of the union. 

Finally, we make an intersection of our two regions.  Because
regions r1 and r2 don't actually intersect, so the region returned
is empty.

</example>

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf Automatic Extension}

One general philosophy behind the regions software is that if you apply
a region to an image, but don't explicitly specify all axes of the image
in that region, then for the unspecified axes, the full image is taken. 
For example, imagine that from an RA/DEC optical image you made an
RA/DEC region.  You then applied it to an RA/DEC/Frequency radio
spectral-line cube.  For the frequency axis, which was not specified in
the region, all frequency pixels would be selected.  Another
philosophy is that if, on application, a region extends beyond an image,
the overhang is silently discarded. 

<example>

- ia.open('myimage')
- ia.boundingbox(rg.box())
[blc=[1 1] , trc=[155 178] , inc=[1 1] , bbShape=[155 178] , regionShape=[155 178] , imageShape=[155 178] ] 
-
- r1 = rg.box(trc=[20])
- ia.boundingbox(r1)
[blc=[1 1] , trc=[20 178] , inc=[1 1] , bbShape=[20 178] , regionShape=[20 178] , imageShape=[155 178] ] 
-
- r2 = rg.box(trc=[9000,20])
- ia.boundingbox(r2)
[blc=[1 1] , trc=[155 20] , inc=[1 1] , bbShape=[155 20] , regionShape=[155 20] , imageShape=[155 178] ] 

In the first example, none of the axes are specified in the region,
so it defaults to the full image on all axes.  In the second example
only the first axis of the trc is specified.  In the third example,
the trc overhang is silently discarded.

</example>

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf Masks}

Some comment about the combination of masks and \regions\ is useful
here.  Consider a simple polygonal region.  This \region\ is defined by
a bounding box, the polygonal vertices, and a mask called a \regionmask.
The \regionmask\ specifies whether a pixel within the bounding box is
inside or outside the polygon.  For a simple box \region, there is
obviously no need for a \regionmask.

Now imagine that you wish to recover the mask of an image from a
polygonal \region.  Now, necessarily, the mask is returned to you in
regular Boolean array.  Thus, the array shape reflects the
<link anchor="images:image.boundingbox.function">bounding-box</link> of the polygonal region. 
If the actual \pixelmask\ that you apply is all good, then the retrieved 
mask would be good inside of the polygonal region and bad outside of it.  If
the actual \pixelmask\ had some bad values in it as well, the
retrieved mask would be bad outside of the polygonal region.  Inside the
polygonal region it would be bad if the \pixelmask\ was bad.

More simply put, the mask that you recover is just a logical ``and'' of
the \pixelmask\ and the \regionmask; if the \pixelmask\ is T {\it and} the   
\regionmask\ is T then the retrieved mask is T (good), else it is F (bad).   

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf Vector Inputs}
 
Many of the functions of a Regionmanager \tool\ take vectors (numeric or
strings) as their arguments.  You can assume that
 
\begin{itemize}
 
\item For numeric vectors you can enter as an actual numeric vector    
(e.g. ['1.2','2.5','3']), a vector of strings (e.g. "1.2 2.5 3") or even
a string with white space and/or comma delimiters (e.g. '1.2 2.5 3').
 
\item For string vectors you can enter as an actual vector of strings
(e.g.  "1.2 2.5 3") or a string with white space or comma delimiters
(e.g.  '1.2 2.5 3').
 
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf Default Values}

When specifying blc and trc vectors for some regions (usually boxes)
it can often be that you wish to default  one axis but not others.

For example, you may like to specify a value for axis 2 but leave axis 1
at its defaults.  This is trivial with the GUI interface (you just don't
fill in the ones you are not interested in), but is a little harder with
the command line interface. 

There is a function called <link anchor="images:regionmanager.def.function">def</link> which
provides a magic value which can be used with pixel boxes for this
purpose.  
For example,

THIS EXAMPLE IS NOT VALID YET

- ia.fromshape('x', [20,30])
- r = rg.box(trc=[rg.dflt(),10])
- ia.boundingbox(region=r)
[blc=[1 1] , trc=[20 10] , regionShape=[20 10] , imageShape=[20 30] ] 


You can see that trc for axis 1 has defaulted to the shape of the image.

With world boxes, we have defined a magic unit called `default'
instead. Thus

<example>

- ia.fromshape('x', [20,30])
- csys = ia.coordsys()
- rg.setcoordinates(csys.torecord())
- r = rg.wbox(trc="0dflt 10pix")
- ia.boundingbox(region=r)
[blc=[1 1] , trc=[20 10] , regionShape=[20 10] , imageShape=[20 30] ] 

</example>

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf Error Checking}

Although some error checking is done when the region is created (in
\casa), much of it does not occur until the region is applied to an
image.  In particular, when creating a compound region, it is {\em not}
checked that the compound region contains only world-coordinate based
regions.  It is only when you apply the region to an image that these
checks are made.  Any errors that occur will cause exceptions to be
generated.  Thus, when writing scripts, you should always use 
try/except blocks as in this example.

<example>

- def getStats(imageobject, blc, trc, csys):
     try :
	r1 = rg.wbox(blc=blc, trc=trc, csys=csys.torecord())
     	imageobject.statistics(r1)
     except Exception, instance:
      	print 'ERROR: ", instance
      	return False

     return True


This fairly silly function detects if the region creation failed
(function given invalid arguments) and displays the exception if
it did.  If all is well statistics are then evaluated from the 
region, and True is returned.

</example>

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf How a region is stored in \aipspp}

In \aipspp, a region is itself a \tool.  This means it can be
transmitted about with \glish, saved to Tables and restored from Tables. 
A region is actually made with a generic container \tool\ called an
<link anchor="misc:itemcontainer">Itemcontainer</link>.  The regions that you make
have no intelligence regarding their greater purpose in life (although of course
an Itemcontainer does have some functions so they can be manipulated).
All of the knowledge about regions lies with the \regionmanager. 
It should not be necessary for you to know anything about the insides of
regions.  You just need to know how to make them and how to use them. 

<example>
THIS EXAMPLE IS NOT VALID ANYMORE

- r1 = rg.box([10,20], [30,40])
- r1
[gui=&lt;function&gt;, done=&lt;function&gt;, get=&lt;function&gt;, has_item=&lt;function&gt;, 
makeconst=&lt;function&gt;, length=&lt;function&gt;, names=&lt;function&gt;, 
set=&lt;function&gt;, add=&lt;function&gt;, fromrecord=&lt;function&gt;, 
torecord=&lt;function&gt;, type=&lt;function&gt;] 
-
- r1.torecord()
[name=LCSlicer, isRegion=3, blc=[10 20] , trc=[30 40] , inc=, 
fracblc=[F F] , fractrc=[F F] , fracinc=, 
arblc=[1 1] , artrc=[1 1] , oneRel=True, comment=] 


First we make a simple pixel-box region.  We then try and print it out. 
You can see that this isn't very enlightening.  What you see are the
Itemcontainer's functions.  To really see inside the region, you can use
the <link anchor="misc:itemcontainer.torecord.function">torecord</link> function of
Itemcontainer.  This converts the region to a record which you can view
if you really must (the record is of no functional use when dealing
with regions).

</example>

It's perhaps also useful to know that once you have made a region
you can't break it.  You can delete it, maybe overwrite it, but you
can't mistakenly mess up its contents (even with the
<link anchor="misc:itemcontainer">Itemcontainer</link> functions with which it was
created).  It's user proof - there's a challenge for you !

\regionmanager\ (you can set a Coordinate System with
<link anchor="images:regionmanager.setcoordinates.function">setcoordinates</link>); the
default \regionmanager\ {\stf rg} should be all you need.

This function is not intended for general user use.

Regions may be specified with coordinates which are absolute or
relative.  This function converts the integer code defining the
absolute/relative type of the coordinates (which is stored in the
region) into a string (maybe for printing purposes).

The different types are


Integer     String      Description
1            abs        Absolute coordinate
2            relref     Relative reference pixel
3            relcen     Relative to center of image
4            reldir     Relative to some direction

<description>

This function creates a multi-dimensional pixel box region.  The box is
specified by a bottom-left corner, and top-right corner and an increment
(or stride).  Pixel coordinates are considered to run from 1 at the
bottom left corner of the image to the image shape at the top-right
corner of the image. 

You can specify whether the coordinates are given as pixel coordinates
({\stfaf frac=F}) or fractions of the image shape ({\stfaf frac=T}). 
Absolute fractions are in the range [0,1]. 

You can also specify whether the coordinates are given as absolute
coordinates ({\stfaf absrel='abs'}) or relative to the reference pixel
({\stfaf absrel='relref'}) or relative to the center of the image
({\stfaf absrel='relcen'}). 

</description>

<example>  

ia.open('myimage')
ia.shape()
[155 178 256]

r = rg.box()                 # create region
-
- ia.boundingbox(r)
[blc=[1 1 1] , trc=[155 178 256] , inc=[1 1 1] , bbShape=[155 178 256] , 
regionShape=[155 178 256] , imageShape=[155 178 256] ] 


This region, on application to an image, selects the entire image.

</example>

<example>  

- ia.open('myimage')
- ia.shape()
[155 178 256]  
-
- r=rg.box(blc=[5,10])
- ia.boundingbox(r)
[blc=[5 10 1] , trc=[155 178 256] , inc=[1 1 1] , bbShape=[151 169 256] , 
regionShape=[151 169 256] , imageShape=[155 178 256] ] 


This region is only specified for the first two axes of the blc.  
Automatic extension rules apply for the other axis and the trc
(defaults to the shape).

</example>

<example>  

- ia.open('myimage')
- ia.shape()
[155 178 256]
-
- r = rg.box(blc=[10, 10, 10], trc=[20, 20, 20], inc=[2, 2, 2])
- ia.boundingbox(r)                                        
[blc=[10 10 10] , trc=[20 20 20] , inc=[2 2 2] , bbShape=[11 11 11] , 
regionShape=[6 6 6] , imageShape=[155 178 256] ] 
-
stats=ia.statistics(region=r, list=False);
stats['npts'][0]
216


This region picks out every other pixel in the 3D box.  The
``regionShape'' field of the bounding box record does reflect the
increment whereas ``bbShape'' does not.  You can see that the number of
points used in determining the statistics (216) reflects the increment
as well. 

</example>

<example>  

THIS EXAMPLE IS NOT VALID YET

- ia.open('myimage')
- ia.shape()
[64 128]  
-
- rmd = rg.dflt()
- r = rg.box([-5,-10], [rmd,20], absrel='relcen')
-
- ia.boundingbox(r)
[blc=[28 55] , trc=[64 85] , inc=[1 1] , bbShape=[37 31] , 
regionShape=[37 31] , imageShape=[64 128] ] 


The region is specified in pixels relative to the center of the image. 
Note the use of the default value ({\cf rg.dflt()}) to default the first
axis of the trc argument to the image shape without having to know the
image shape. 

</example>

<example>  

- ia.open('myimage')
- ia.shape()
[155 178 256] 
-
- summ=ia.summary(list=False)
- summ['header']['refpix']

-
- r = rg.box([-0.25,-0.3], [0.25, 0.5], frac=True, absrel='relref')
- ia.boundingbox(r)
[blc=[39 37 1] , trc=[116 178 256] , inc=[1 1 1] , bbShape=[78 142 256] , 
regionShape=[78 142 256] , imageShape=[155 178 256] ] 


This example shows selection by relative to reference pixel fractional
coordinates plus auto extension to unspecified axes.

This function (short-hand name {\tt comp}) creates the complement of
a world region(s). 

The region parameter can be a single region record defining a simple
or complex region or it can contain several region records in a 
Python dictionary.  If multiple regions are given then the union of
this set of regions is taken first, and the complement is found from
the union.

NOTE: ia.statistics() is UNABLE to handle complement regions in CASA yet.

<description>
This function (short-hand name {\tt concat}) creates a region which is
the concatenation along a new axis of the given world regions. 

This function is similar to the
<link anchor="images:regionmanager.extension.function">extension</link> function.  The
{\stfaf concatenation} function allows you to take many world regions,
and concatenate them along one axis (rather than take one region and
extend it along many axes which is what function {\stff extension}
does).

For example, you may have generated a different polygonal region for
each spectral pixel of a spectral-line cube and you wish to concatenate them
together to form the overall region for use in a deconvolution
application. 

The axis to concatenate along is specified as a 1-dimensional world box.
The shape of the 1D box must contain as many pixels (although you
don't have to specify it in pixels) as there are regions
to concatenate.   

Because this function is most likely to be used in a script, the
interface takes a record containing {\stff region} records, Python
dictionaries, as there might be a lot of them.

In this example, we create a 1D box and use it to concatenate 2D xy

in the region.  There is a differerent number of pixels per plane 
as each polygon is different.

structure beyond housing the regions for you. 

If desired, you can request confirmation prompting to prevent accidental
overwrite of existing regions.

This function returns a value which can be used as a default when

We use pixel units and boxes in this example to make it clear what is
happening.  The two regions overlap in the top right corner area of
region {\stf r1} by an area of $11\times11=121$~pixels.  Therefore, the
difference region {\stf r3} has $2601-121=2480$~pixels in it.  For
difference region {\stf r4}, the region of overlap is the bottom left
corner area of region {\stf r2} and still contains 121~pixels.  We expect
$961-121=840$~pixels in the differnce region.

This function (short-hand name {\stff ext}) creates a region which
is the extension over specified dimensions along straight lines of the
given region.  For example, you might like to extend a 2-D polygon to be
a 3-D `cylindrical polygon' (that is, the polygon is replicated for
each plane). 

The extension is specified with a world box.  It can be of any
dimension.  However, you can't put the same axes in the extension box as
are in the region you are extending. 

</description>

<example>

- ia.open('cube')
- csys = ia.coordsys()
- ia.shape()
[155 178 64]  
-
- rg.setcoordinates(csys.torecord())
-
- x = qa.quantity([40,45,48,55,48,43,40], 'pix')
- y = qa.quantity([40,43,59,60,53,48,45], 'pix')
- poly = rg.wpolygon(x, y, [1,3])
- box = rg.wbox(qa.quantity("20pix"), qa.quantity("30pix"), [2])
- 
- ext = rg.extension(box, poly, 'a cylindrical polygon')
-
- ia.boundingbox(poly)
[blc=[40 1 40] , trc=[55 178 60] , inc=[1 1 1] , bbShape=[16 178 21] ,
regionShape=[16 178 21] , imageShape=[155 178 256] ] 
-
- ia.boundingbox(box)
[blc=[1 20 1] , trc=[155 30 256] , inc=[1 1 1] , bbShape=[155 11 256] ,
regionShape=[155 11 256] , imageShape=[155 178 256] ]

- ia.boundingbox(ext)
[blc=[40 20 40] , trc=[55 30 60] , inc=[1 1 1] , bbShape=[16 11 21] ,
regionShape=[16 11 21] , imageShape=[155 178 256] ] 


In this example we create a 2D polygon in the XZ plane.  We then create
a 1D box along the Y axis from pixels 20 to 30.  Then we extend the
polygon with that box to make a series of XZ polygons for the specified Y
pixels. 

Note that when the {\stfaf box} and {\stfaf poly} regions are applied to the
image with the {\stfaf boundingbox} function, the auto-extension operation
is applied.  It is not until the region has as many dimensions as the
image (the region {\stfaf ext}) that no auto-extension occurs.

The intended use for this method is to read the file saved by the casa

image analysis tool.

</description>

<example>

- img = ia.open('hcn')

- ia.statistics( region=r2, verbose=True ) 

 
In this example, we create two regions called  {\stf r1} and {\stf r2} 
from the files ???
The regions are renamed to `x1' and `x2' as they are stored.

</example>
<example>
e
- img = ia.open('hcn')

In this example, we save two regions called {\stf r1} and {\stf r2} to
the table (previously containing no regions) referred to by the image
tool {\stf im}.  The names for regions are made up for us as we don't
specify them.  Note that because the regions are specified by the
special \glish\ `...' argument (it has no actual argument name), we
must give the {\stfaf regionname} argument explcitly as an empty vector

This function restores a region from an \aipspp\ Table
to the global name space.

For the {\stfaf tablename} argument, you can specify an
<link anchor="images:image">image</link> \tool, a <link anchor="table:table">table</link> \tool,
or a string.  If you give a string, it should be the name of an existing

If {\stfaf numberfields} is F, then the field names of the
record are the same as they are in the Table.  Otherwise,
the regions are put into numbered fields (the field
names could be anything).

You can use the function
<link anchor="images:regionmanager.namesintable.function">namesintable</link> to find out the
names of the regions in the Table.

<example>

- img = ia.open('hcn')

Number points = 51            



In this example, we use pixel coordinates so that it is clear what is
happening.  You can see that the number of pixels in the intersection
(51) is less than the number in the bounding box of the intersection
(121) because the intersection is actually polygonal and does not fill
the bounding box.

When the polygon only is applied, it is auto extended along the third
axis.  The {\stff statistics} function finds 6400 pixels in the region,
which is $6400/256=25$ pixels per plane.  Likewise, when the box only is
applied, the {\stff statistics} function finds 32256 pixels in the
region, which is $32256/256=126$ pixels per plane.  When the union is
applied, the {\stff statistics} function finds 38656 pixels in the
region.  First it finds the union of the polygon and box (which are
specified only in the XY plane) and that union is extended.  Thus we
expect $(25+126)*256=38656$ pixels in the region of the union, as found.

<description>

This function creates a multi-dimensional world box region; the
corners of the box are specified in world coordinates.  However, the box
is not a true world volume in that its sides do not follow world
contours.  Its sides are parallel to the pixel axes.  If you are in a
region of high world coordinate contour non-linearity (e.g.  near a
pole), you are probably better off using a world polygon. 

The box is specified by a bottom-left corner, and a top-right corner. 
The coordinates are given as quantities, and you can give a vector of
quantities (e.g.  {\cf blc = qa.quantity("1rad 20deg")} or a
quantity of a vector (e.g.{\cf blc = qa.quantity([10,30], 'rad')}). 

You can specify whether the coordinates are given as absolute coordinates
({\stfaf absrel='abs'}) or relative to the reference pixel ({\stfaf 
absrel='relref'}) or relative to the center of the image ({\stfaf
absrel='relcen'}).  You can specify this for each axis (the same for the
blc and trc).   If you specify less values than the number of
values in {\stfaf blc} or {\stfaf trc} then the last value you
did specify is used as the default for all higher numbered axes
(e.g. {\stfaf absrel='relref'} means {\stfaf absrel="relref relref"}
for two axes).

You specify which pixel axes in the image the {\stfaf blc} and {\stfaf
trc} vector refer to with the {\stfaf pixelaxes} argument.  If you
don't, it defaults to [0,1,2,...].  This specification is an important
part of world regions. 

You must also specify the Coordinate System with the {\stfaf csys}
argument.  The Coordinate System is encapsulated in a {\stfaf coordinates}
tool and can be recovered from an image with the
<link anchor="images:image.coordsys.function">coordsys</link> tool function.  You can
also set a default Coordinate System in the \regionmanager\ with the
<link anchor="images:regionmanager.setcoordinates.function">setcoordinates</link> 
function.

In the \regionmanager\ we have defined units `pix' and `frac'; these are
then known to the <link anchor="quanta:quanta">quanta</link> system.  This means
that you can effectively define a pixel box (except for the stride
capability) as a world box with most of the advantages of world regions
(can be used for compound regions).  However, it is still not very
portable to other images because the coordinates are pixel based,
not world based. 

Note that the need to deal with the {\stfaf pixelaxes} and {\stfaf csys}
is hidden from you when using the <link anchor="images:regionmanager.gui.function">gui</link>
interface of the \regionmanager.

We have specified an RA and DEC for the blc and the trc (they should
be quantities; for blc we do that explicitly, but for the trc
we just give a vector of strings which is automatically converted
for us to a vector of quantities).

From the {\stff summary} listing you can see that RA and DEC correspond
to pixel axes 3 and 2 respectively (don't be confused by the dual
listing for the spectral axis) so that is why the {\stfaf pixelaxes}
argument is set to [3,2].  If we had set blc/trc in DEC/RA order then we
would have put {\stfaf pixelaxes=[1,2]}.  For the unspecified frequency
axis, all pixels are selected.

In this example, we use pixel coordinates relative to the reference
pixel for the RA axis and absolute world coordinates for the DEC axis. 
We also set the state of the \regionmanager\ with a Coordinate
System to use when making world regions.  You can see that when the
region was made, a message was issued reminding you that the internal
Coordinate System from the image {\sff bork} was being used.

we used different units for the blc and trc).  Therefore, on
application, the region selected for the RA and DEC axes is
automatically the full image.

<description>

This function (short-hand name {\stff wpoly}) creates a 2D world
polygon region.  The polygon is specified by an {\stfaf x} and a {\stfaf y}
vector.  These must be quantities of a vector (the 
<link anchor="images:regionmanager.wbox.function">world box</link> function
allows both
quantities of vectors and vectors of quantities).  This means that the
units are common to all elements of each vector.  Thus, {\cf
qa.quantity([1,2,3],'rad')} (a quantity of a vector) is different from
{\cf qa.quantity("1rad 2rad 3rad")} (a vector of quantities) although
the information that they specify is the same. 

You specify which pixel axes in the image the {\stfaf x} and {\stfaf 
y} vectors pertain to with the {\stfaf pixelaxes} argument.  If you don't,
it defaults to [0,1].  This specification is an important part of
world regions. 

You can specify whether the {\stfaf x} and {\stfaf y} vector coordinates are
given as absolute coordinates ({\stfaf absrel='abs'}) or relative to the
reference pixel ({\stfaf absrel='relref'}) or relative to the center of the
image ({\stfaf absrel='relcen'}).  This argument applies to both the axes
of the polygon. 

You must also specify the Coordinate System with the {\stfaf csys}
argument.  The Coordinate System is encapsulated in a {\stfaf coordinates}
\tool\ and can be recovered from an image with the
<link anchor="images:image.coordsys.function">coordsys</link> function.  You can
also set a default Coordinate System in the Regionmanager with the
<link anchor="images:regionmanager.setcoordinates.function">setcoordinates</link> 
function.

In the \regionmanager\ we have defined units `pix' and `frac'; these are
then known to the <link anchor="quanta:quanta">quanta</link> system.  This means
that you can effectively define a pixel box (except for the stride
capability) as a world box with most of the advantages of world regions
(can be used for compound regions).  However, it is still not very
portable to other images because the coordinates are pixel based,
not world based. 

Note that the need to deal with the {\stfaf pixelaxes} and {\stfaf csys}
is hidden from you when using the <link anchor="images:regionmanager.gui.function">gui</link>
interface of the \regionmanager.

<example>  

ia.open('myim.im')
csys = ia.coordsys()
x = ["3pix", "6pix", "9pix", "6pix", "5pix","5pix","3pix"]
y = ["3pix","4pix","7pix","9pix","7pix","5pix","5pix"]
r1 = rg.wpolygon(x=x, y=y, pixelaxes=[0,1], csys=csys.torecord())
stats = ia.statistics(region=r1)
ia.done()


We applied the 2D polygon, defined in the XY plane with absolute pixel
coordinates, to a 3D image.  Therefore, the third (Z) axis was
automatically extended to the whole image.

NOT IMPLEMENTED IN CASA

This function creates a mask region.   This region can be applied
on-the-fly to images.  The expression must be Boolean.

</description>

<example>  

- ia.imagemaketestimage('zz')
- r = rg.wmask(expr='zz&gt;0')
- ia.statistics(region=r.torecord())


The mask region effectively creates a (notional) Boolean
lattice.    In this example, when the pixel values
are greater than zero, the lattice is True (good), else
False.  The statistics, when evaluated, are then
only computed when the mask region is True.

</example>

<example>  

- ia.imagemaketestimage('zz')
- rg.setcoordinates(ia.coordsys().torecord() )
#
- r1 = rg.wbox(...)                 # Make a world box
- r2 = rg.wmask(expr='zz&gt;0')        # Make a mask region
- r3 = rg.intersection (r1,r2)      # Intersect them
- ia.statistics(region=r3)            # Find statistics


In this example, the mask is only applied when
the pixels fall in the specified box.
