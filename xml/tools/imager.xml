This is used to construct {\tt imager} tools associated
with a MeasurementSet. The {\tt imager} tool may then be
used to generate various types of images. Note that
a new executable is started every time the constructor

   <shortdescription>Advise (and optionally use) parameter values</shortdescription>
   

<description>
Advise on recommended values of certain parameters. Return these
values and optionally use them in Imager.

The calculations are performed as following:

\begin{description}
\item[cell] The maximum uv distance in wavelength is found and then half of the
inverse is taken as the maximum cellsize allowed.
\item[pixels] The field of view is converted to a number of pixels
using the calculated cell size.
\item[facets] The number of facets on an axis is calculated in two
different ways. The first method simply requires that the peeling of 
facets away from the celestial sphere should not cause an amplitude
drop of more than the argument {\tt amplitudeloss}. The positions may
be incorrect, but all the sources will be removed correctly. The
second method requires that the source positions be accurate to the
same fraction of the beam specified by {\tt amplitudeloss}. The 
second calculates the second moment in w and in uv distance and
chooses the number of facets correspondingly. The first method does
the same but after fitting a plane to the sampling: $w = a u + b v$.
For an approximately coplanar array, the positions may be wrong but
the removal of sidelobes will be accurate. The number of facets
returned is the second, usually smaller, number. The formula used
is:
\begin{equation}
N\_{facets} = N\_{pixels} \sqrt{{{\Delta \theta}\over{\sqrt{8 \delta A}}}{w\_{rms}}\over{uv\_{rms}}}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta \theta$ is the cellsize in radians, and $\delta A$ is
the amplitude loss. This formula can be derived from (a) the peeling
of facets from the celestial sphere, and (b) a quadratic approximation 
for the beam size both in the plane of the sky and along the $w$ axis.

   <shortdescription>Advise on spw and chan selection optimal for the image frequency range wanted</shortdescription>
   

<description>
 Basically tells you what channels of which spectral window need to be
 selected for your image spectral parameters.  The freqstep is used to
 calulate the extra padding needed for data selection at the begining
 and end of the range.  The freqframe parameter is the frame in which
 the frequency range is being given. It will be converted to the frame
 of the data with time to locate which channel match.
 A record will be returned with an element for each ms  used in selectvis.
 Each element of the record will have the spwids and channel start and nchan for each spwid.
  if the parameter msname is used then the MSs associated associated with
  this tool (that have been either 'open'ed or 'selectvis'ed) are ignored
  In this mode it is a helper function to the general world ...no need to
  open or selectvis. You need to specify the field\_id for which this calculation is 
  being done for in the helper mode. 
  If you have already set MS's and selected data and msname="" then 
  the calulation is done for the field(s) selected in selectvis.

If the parameter {\tt getfreqrange=True} then the reverse is requested. You set {\tt spwselection} to be the range of data selection you want to use and you'll get the range of frequency covered in the frame you set.

<example>
In this example, we are interested in an image cube which span 20.0682GHz to 20.1982 in LSRK  which will have a channel resolution of 3.9MHz. The field we are interested is field 4 of each of the ms.


#######
im.selectvis(vis='test1.ms', field='4', spw='*')
im.selectvis(vis='test2.ms', field='4', spw='*')
selinfo=im.advisechansel(freqstart=2.00682e10, freqend=2.01982e10, freqstep=3.9e3, freqframe="LSRK")
####The output "selfinfo" will be a record which will look like thus
{'ms_0': {'nchan': array([109,  23], dtype=int32),
          'spw': array([4, 5], dtype=int32),
          'start': array([19,  0], dtype=int32)},
 'ms_1': {'nchan': array([109,  23], dtype=int32),
          'spw': array([4, 5], dtype=int32),
          'start': array([19,  0], dtype=int32)}}
###
Thus from the first ms a spw selection like  '4:19~127, 5:0~22'  is all that is needed. 
Similarly from the second ms.

###if you need this info without needing to change the state of the imager tool 
then you can it as follows

im.advisechansel(freqstart=2.00682e10, freqend=2.01982e10, freqstep=3.9e3, freqframe="LSRK", msname="test1.ms", fieldid=4)


####now if you want to see what frequency range is covered, in the frame 
####defined by freqframe, in spwselection you want to use
im.selectvis(vis='test3.ms', spw='0:20~210')
im.advisechansel(getfreqrange=True, freqframe="LSRK")
### the output will be something
 {'freqend': 346020345384.64178, 'freqstart': 345683852920.1723}

###and if you just want to use it as a helper function without touching the state 
###of imager

im.advisechansel(msname='test3.ms', getfreqrange=True, spwselection='0:20~210')

<description>
Calculate the approximate point spread function.
{\em Note that the model visibilities are updated}.

Some types of imaging do not yield a well-defined point spread
function. For example, mosaicing or single dish imaging both yield
point spread functions that are position dependent. Nevertheless, one
can still usefully define an {\em approximate} PSF that is of some
utility. This is calculated by doing the following calculation: a
point source is located at the center of the specified coordinate
system and the model data predicted. The approximate PSF is then formed from
those model data using the full sky equation. For regular sampling in
the image plane, this approximate PSF is actually quite good. It can
be used in a deconvolution. For a mosaic with similar uv sampling per
pointing, the approximate PSF is roughly the PSF per pointing
multiplied by the primary beam. For a single dish image, it is roughly
the telescope primary beam convolved with itself (if the
gridfunction='pb' was selected).

<description>
A mask image is an image with the same shape as the other images but
with values between 0.0 and 1.0 as a pixel value. Mask images are used in
imager to control the region selected in a deconvolution. 

In the Clark CLEAN, the mask image can usefully have any value between
0.0 and 1.0. Intermediate value discourage but do not rule out
selection of clean components in that region. This is accomplished by
multiplying the residual image by the mask prior to entering the minor
cycle. Note that if you do use a mask for the Clark or Hogbom Clean,
it must cover only a quarter of the image. boxmask does not enforce
this requirement.

   <method type="function" name="clean">
   <shortdescription>Calculate a deconvolved image with selected clean algorithm</shortdescription>
   
<description>
Makes a clean image using either the Hogbom, Clark, multi-scale or multi-field
algorithms. The Clark algorithm is the default. The clean is performed
on the residual image calculated from the visibility data currently
selected. Hence the first step performed in clean is to transform the
current model or models (optionally including a componentlist) to fill
in the MODEL\_DATA column, and then inverse transform the residual
visibilities to get a residual image. This residual image is then
cleaned using the corresponding point spread function. This means that
the initial model is used as the starting point for the
deconvolution. Thus if you want to restart a clean, simply set the
model to the model that was previously produced by clean.

Rather than explicit CLEAN boxes, mask images are used to constrain
the region that is to be deconvolved. To make mask images,
use either <link anchor="imager:imager.boxmask.function">boxmask</link> (to define a mask
via the corner locations blc and trc) or 
<link anchor="imager:imager.mask.function">mask</link> (to define a mask via
thresholding an existing image) or <link anchor="imager:imager.regionmask.function">regionmask</link> (to make masks via regions using the regionmanager or interactively through the viewer)  . The default mask is the inner quarter
of the image.

The CLEAN deconvolution is joint in whatever Stokes parameters are
present. Thus it searchs for peaks in either $I$ or $I+|V|$ or
$I+\sqrt{Q^2+U^2+V^2}$, the rationale for the latter two forms being
to be biased towards finding strongly polarized pixels first (these
forms are also the maximum eigenvalue of the coherency matrix).  The
PSF is constrained to be the same in all polarizations (a feature of
this implementation, not of the Hamaker-Bregman-Sault formalism). But the option of 
searching peaks in the stokes planes independently is available via 
the {\tt clarkstokes} parameter



The clean algorithms possible are:
\begin{description}
\item[Hogbom] The classic algorithm: points are found iteratively
by searching for the peak. Each point is subtracted from the
full residual image using the shifted and scaled point spread
function.
\item[Multiscale] An experimental multi-scale clean algorithm is invoked.
The algorithm is fully described in 
<link anchor="deconvolver:deconvolver.clean.function">deconvolver</link>.
\item[Clark] The faster algorithm: the cleaning is split into
minor and major cycles. In the minor cycles only the brightest
points are cleaned, using a subset of the point spread function.
In the major cycle, the points thus found are subtracted correctly
by using an FFT-based convolution.
\item[Multi-field] Cleaning is split into minor and major
cycles. For each field, a Clark-style minor cycle is performed. 
In the major cycle, the points thus found are subtracted
either from the original visibilities (for multiple fields)
or using a convolution (for only one field). The latter is
much faster.  Multi-field imaging has been implemented for
Clark, Hogbom, and Multi-scale deconvolution algorithms.
\item[Cotton-Schwab] Cleaning is split into minor and major
cycles. For each field, a Clark-style minor cycle is performed. 
In the major cycle, the points thus found are subtracted
from the original visibilities. A fast variant does a convolution
using a FFT. This will be faster for large numbers of
visibilities. Double the image size from that used for Cotton-Schwab
and set a mask to clean only the inner quarter.
\item[Wide-field] The user will need to use a wide-field algorithm to
deconvolve if the array is not coplanar over the field of view being
imaged . The technique used is to break the field being imaged into
smaller pieces (facets), over each of which the array appear
planar. We implement a rectangular facetting scheme. If the number of
facets specified in <link anchor="imager:imager.defineimage.function">defineimage</link> is
greater than one, Either wfhogbom or wfclark algorithm has to be
selected here to perform a wide-field decovolution. The function
<link anchor="imager:imager.advise.function">advise</link> can be used to calculate or
check if you need to use a wide-field deconvolution. Note that
aliasing can be reduced by using the {\tt padding} argument in
<link anchor="imager:imager.setoptions.function">setoptions</link>. In practice the
previous sentence means that if you notice the clean to diverge at the
edges of the facets then you need to use a larger amount of padding
for the FT; the default being 1.2. Wide-field imaging has been
implemented for Clark and Hogbom algorithms.
\end{description}

The multi-field clean should be used if either of two conditions
hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Multiple fields are to be cleaned simultaneously {\bf OR}
\item Primary beam correction is enabled. In this case, a
mosaiced clean is performed.
\end{enumerate}

Note that for the single pointing algorithms, only a quarter of the
image may be cleaned. If no mask is set, then the cleaned region
defaults to the inner quarter. If a mask larger than a quarter of the
image is set, then only the inner quarter part of that mask is used.
However, for the wide-field and multi-field imaging (including the
Cotton-Schwab algorithm), the entire field may be imaged because the
major cycles either do an exact subtraction from the visibilities or
because PSF extent is more than twice the extent of the primary beam
support.

Before {\tt clean} can be run, you must run {\tt selectvis} and {\tt defineimage}.
Before {\tt clean} can be run with a multi-field algorithm (especially for mosaic), you should run
{\tt setvp}.  You may want to run {\tt setmfcontrol} before running {\tt clean}
with a multi-field or wide-field algorithm, though the default control values
may be acceptable.  Before {\tt clean} can be run with a multi-scale algorithm,
{\tt setscales} must be run.


Interactive cleaning/masking: If the user wants to see what the clean
image looks like after npercycle iteration and mask or modify the mask
each time, he/she should set {\tt interactive=True} and give npercycle to a
fraction of niter. A viewer with the last residual image along with an
overlayed mask appear after every npercycle iteration. The user can
add or delete regions (by clicking on the appropriate button) to the
mask using the region button and drawing regions and double clicking
inside the region. When satisfied and ready to continue cleaning press 'DONE
with masking' (if the user want to terminate the cleaning process use
the 'STOP' button). The button 'No more mask changes' should be used
if the user want clean to proceed without any further interruption.
Even if {\tt interactive=False}, and if the parameter
'mask' is non-empty, it is still used in limiting the search area for
clean components.  If the parameter 'masktemplate' is not empty this
means that the user want to use an apriori image to make the mask the
first time (e.g a previously cleaned image)

This function returns a record containing convergence, iterations used and threshold reached.

A few points should be noted in this example:

\begin{itemize}
\item When the mask parameter is specified, the number of mask images
      listed should be equal to the number of model images.  They
      should also have the same coordinate system as their
      corresponding model images.  
\item If one or more model images are listed in the model parameter
      but the image and residual parameters are empty, the restored
      and residual images are automatically named as the model names
      appended with '.restored' and '.residual', respectively.
\item No restored or residual image is made if the respective image 
      string is explicitly unset.

   <method type="function" name="defineimage">
   <shortdescription>Set the image parameters for subsequent processing</shortdescription>
   
<description>
Define the default image parameters. If an image is to be
made, then these parameters are used in the construction
of the image. Thus, for example, the tool function <link anchor="imager:imager.make.function">make</link>
makes an (empty) image using these parameters. 

Note that some parameters can be specified either in canonical units
or via measures. To establish default values, the ids for the default
spectral window and default field id must be given.

The parameter {\tt mode} can be one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item mfs
\item channel
\item velocity or opticalvelocity
\item frequency
\end{itemize}

{\tt imager} can perform multi-frequency synthesis over several
spectral windows (mode='mfs'). To achieve this, you should set spwid
to an array of the required spectral windows ({\em e.g.}  {\tt
spwid=[0,1]}).\\ WARNING: For multifrequency synthesis, 'mfs', it is
important that the spwid's selected in <link
anchor="imager:imager.selectvis.function">selectvis</link> be the SAME
as the one selected in {\tt defineimage}.  Otherwise the frequency at which
the image is made is not going to be the same as to the one as the one
used in gridding the visibility and can lead to image artifacts.  For
{\tt mode='velocity'} and {\tt mode='frequency'} the {\tt step}
parameter has to be a measure/quantity of velocity or frequency,
otherwise for {\tt mode='channel'} step is the number of data
channels to be averaged to make one image channel( see examples
below).


The phase center of the image defaults to that of the specified
phasecenter (the first fieldid in the ms is taken if none is
specified), this parameter can be a fieldid or a measure string or the
record output from the direction function of the measures tool( <link
 anchor="measures:measures.direction.function">direction</link> ).  
This is important if you have multiple pointings in the data. The user 
would have used <link anchor="imager:imager.selectvis.function">selectvis</link> to select which pointings would be used in imaging. If the
conversion from the observed direction requires frame information then
this is taken as follows: \begin{itemize} \item Direction information,
including the coordinate system, is taken from the relevant entry in
the Field table of the MeasurementSet.  \item The epoch is taken from
the time of observation of each visibility.  \item A position is
specified via the {\tt imager} tool function <link
anchor="imager:imager.setoptions.function">setoptions</link>
\end{itemize}

If the specified number of facets is greater than unity then the image
is split into facets (this number along the x and y axes) and
processed. This is necessary when using wide-field algorithm for
deconvolving the image, in cases of non-coplanar arrays (e.g the VLA
at low frequencies but can be safely left at 1 for the ATCA or WSRT).
This is now recommended only when memory or image size is of a problem, 
otherwise for widefield issues, wprojection (ftmachine parameter in <link
anchor="imager:imager.setoptions.function">setoptions</link>) is recommended with a single 
facet. 

For spectral imaging {\tt defineimage} and {\tt selectvis} defines the
spectral channels that are imaged. Examples are given in the <link
anchor="imager:imager.selectvis.function">selectvis</link> section.
The parameter {\tt restfreq} can be used to define what rest frequency
to use in the resulting images. If none is specified imager will try
to use the one that is defined in the ms. It will use the first one
defined in the first spectral window selected.

For wide-field or 3D imaging see <link anchor="imager:imager.setoptions.function">setoptions</link>
section for some examples.

If the telescope is observing moving source (e.g planet or moon) over
a period of time. One may wish to image in a frame where the source is
fixed. The parameter {\tt movingsource} is for that. Setting it to a
source that {\tt measures} is aware of will force the imaging to
realign (shift in SD imaging or phase rotation in interferometry
imaging) the data so that the source appears fixed in the
image. Obviously in doing so the background sources will be
blurred. The coordinate system used to fix the source on is the one where
the source is at the first time observed in the selected data.

## Example 1
im.defineimage(nx=1024,ny=1024, cellx='30marcsec',celly='30marcsec', 
nchan=1, stokes='IV', phasecenter=me.direction('mars'));
## Example 2
im.defineimage(nx=1024,ny=1024, cellx='30marcsec',celly='30marcsec', 
nchan=1, stokes='IV', phasecenter=['J2000', '19:00:30.5', '-45d00m25.6']);
## Example 3
im.selectvis(nchan=10, start=3, spw=[0,1], field=[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10])
im.defineimage(nx=500, ny=500, mode='mfs', spwid=[0,1], fieldid=7)
im.clean(algorithm='mfclark', niter=1000, model='mosaic.model', image='mosaic.image') 

## Example 4

dir1=me.direction('J2000', '20h00m00', '21d00m00')
dir2=me.direction('J2000', '20h10m00', '21d00m00')
dir3=me.direction('J2000', '20h00m00', '21d03m00')
im.defineimage(nx=100,  cellx='0.1arcsec', phasecenter=dir1)
im.make('box1')
im.defineimage(nx=100, cellx='0.1arcsec', phasecenter=dir2)
im.make('box2')
im.defineimage(nx=100, cellx='0.1arcsec', celly='0.1arsec', phasecenter=dir3)
im.make('box3')
im.clean(algorithm='mfclark', model=['box1', 'box2', 'box3'], 
	   image=['box1.restored', 'box2.restored', 'box3.restored'],
	   residual=['box1.residual', 'box2.residual', 'box3.residual'])



In the first example, the image parameters are set for 1024 by 1024
pixels of 30milli arcsec, 1 channel will be made, Stokes I and V will be
imaged, and the phasecenter will be the direction of Mars as given by
the JPL DE-200 emphemeris. In the second, the phase center is taken
to be an absolute coordinate value.

The third example shows the use of selectvis and defineimage to setup a mosaic. In 
the set data we have chosen 10 channels (for each spectral window) of data starting form 
channel 3. We also have selected spectral windows 0 and 1. We have selected data from 
fields 3 to 10. In the defineimage we decide to use the data to make a 
multifrequency synthesis image. We center the image on the field 7 pointing.  

The fourth example is use to clean regions where the user knows the
sources are and ignore all the other regions. This is very efficient
in large fields with few sources. Smaller outlier images are made and
deconvolved around known sources rather than making a big image
englobing all three fields. 


Now here are some examples about defining cubes using different {\tt mode}
parameters.


defining channels cubes use the channel as defined in the data

im.defineimage(cellx=1000, mode='channel', nchan=100, start=10,
step=1, spwid=range(0,10))


now using frequency and overiding the rest frequency defined in
the ms or if its not defined in the ms

im.defineimage(cellx=1000, mode='frequency', nchan=100, start='1GHz',
step='10kHz', restfrequency='1.421GHz')


in case you have a frame with the frequency

im.defineimage(cellx=1000, mode='frequency', nchan=100, start=['LSRK',
'1GHz'], step='10kHz', restfrequency='1.421GHz')


OR using measures

freqstart=me.frequency('LSRK', '1GHz')
im.defineimage(cellx=1000, mode='frequency', nchan=100,
start=freqstart, step='10kHz', restfrequency='1.421GHz')


similarly if you want to use  velocity to define your cube

im.defineimage(cellx=1000, mode='velocity', nchan=100, start=['LSRK',
'10km/s'], step='1m/s', restfrequency='1.421GHz')
OR using measures
velstart=me.radialvelocity('LSRK', '10km/s')
im.defineimage(cellx=1000, mode='velocity', nchan=100, start=velstart,
step='1m/s')


Change mode to 'opticalvelocity' if your velocity values are using  optical definition

A mask image is an image with the same shape as the other images but

imager to control the region selected in a deconvolution. 

In the Clark CLEAN, the mask image can usefully have any value between
0.0 and 1.0. Intermediate value discourage but do not rule out
selection of clean components in that region. This is accomplished by
multiplying the residual image by the mask prior to entering the minor
cycle. Note that if you do use a mask for the Clark or Hogbom Clean,
it must cover only a quarter of the image. boxmask does not enforce
this requirement.

This function allows Lattice Express Language (LEL) expressions to

   <method type="function" name="feather">

<description> 
Basically the "imerg" algorithm of AIPS and SDE, or the "feather"
algorithm of MIRIAD, we regrid the total power (or low resolution)
image onto the interferometer (or high resolution) image, Fourier
transform both the interferometer and single dish images, down weight
the Fourier transform of the interferometer image by 1.0 - FT(low res psf),
add the weighted interferometer Fourier plane to the single dish Fourier
plane, and transform back into the image plane.

The tapering is by the transform of a point spread function. If lowpsf
is specified, that image is used, otherwise the appropriate telescope
beam is used. The point spread function for a single dish image may be
calculated using <link anchor="imager:imager.makeimage.function">makeimage</link>. 

{\tt Advice:} Note that if you are feathering large images, you'd be advised to have
the number of pixels along the X and Y axes to be composite numbers
and  definitely not  prime numbers. In general FFTs work much faster on even
and composite numbers. You may use <link anchor="image:image.subimage.function">subimage function of image

vpman.setpbgauss(telescope='OTHER', othertelescope='BONN',

vpman.saveastable('bonn.pb')
vpman.done()

##....would have done  your usual imager setup (defineimage etc) then before feathering
im.setvp(dovp=True, usedefaultvp=false, vptable='bonn.pb')
im.feather(image='feathered.image', highres='casa.vlaonly',

Apply visibility tapering to emphasize certain scale structures.  The
imaging tapers are applied to a Table column called IMAGING\_WEIGHT,
which may be plotted using 
tb and pl.
<link anchor="imager:imager.plotweights.function">plotweights</link>. 
In addition, this column
may be accessed directly using either the <link anchor="table">table</link>
or <link anchor="ms">ms</link> modules. Note that the taper is multiplicative and
so the weights must be calculated first using
<link anchor="imager:imager.weight.function">weight</link>. The points are not flagged!

Note that the scale size to be emphasized is given in the image plane
as the parameters of the corresponding Gaussian. Note also use of this
function provides an optimum detection for the given scale size, which
is not the same as requiring that the resulting dirty beam have the
specified Gaussian fit. The resultant fitted beam size will {\em very
roughly} be the quadratic sum of the original beam and the specified
beam. If you wish to obtain a specified beam, then the best approach
is to perform this calculation and check the value obtained using
<link anchor="imager:imager.fitpsf.function">imager.fitpsf</link>.

   <shortdescription>Calculate images by gridding, etc.</shortdescription>
   
<description>
This tool function actually does gridding (and Fourier inversion if
needed) of visibility data to make an image. It allows calculation of
various types of image:
\begin{description}
\item[observed] Make the dirty image from the DATA column ({\em default})
\item[model] Make the dirty image from the MODEL\_DATA column
\item[corrected] Make the dirty image from the CORRECTED\_DATA column
\item[residual] Make the dirty image from the difference of the
CORRECTED\_DATA and MODEL\_DATA columns
\item[psf] Make the point spread function
\item[singledish] Make a single dish image
\item[coverage] Make a single dish coverage image
\item[holography] Make a complex holography image
\item[pb] Make the primary beam as defined by <link anchor="imager:imager.setvp.function">setvp</link>
\end{description}

Note the full {\tt imager} equation is not used and so, for example, the
primary beam correction is not performed. Use
<link anchor="imager:imager.restore.function">restore</link> to get a residual image
using the full {\tt imager} equation where primary beam correction is
performed.

A position shift can be applied when specifying the image parameters
with <link anchor="imager:imager.defineimage.function">defineimage</link>. If a shift is specified then
the uvw coordinates are reprojected prior to gridding, and a phase
rotation is applied. If the image is a PSF then no phase shift is
applied but the uvw are recomputed. To see the effects of the uvw
reprojected, you can use the
<link anchor="imager:imager.plotuv.function">plotuv</link> function.

If desired, the full complex image (before conversion to stokes
I,Q,U,V) may be retained. Note that the <link anchor="images:image">image</link>
tool cannot load a complex image directly. Instead, use the
<link anchor="images:image.imagecalc.constructor">imagecalc</link> constructor 
to take {\em e.g.}  the real and imaginary parts of the image.

For making single dish and holography images, the data are convolved onto the
grid using a one of a number of options:
\begin{description}
\item[gridfunction='SF'] Circularly symmetric prolate spheroidal wavefunction. 
This is always the same function in pixels.  To get this to match to
the antenna primary beam, the optimum cellsize to use in constructing
the image is the antenna primary beam half-width-half-maximum times
1.20192.
\item[gridfunction='BOX'] Nearest neighbor gridding.
\item[gridfunction='PB'] The telescope primary beam is used as the
convolution function. This function is the same in arcseconds,
independent of the cellsize. This choice is optimum in the least
squares sense. To override the default choice of telescope primary beam
for a given telescope, use the function
<link anchor="synthesis:imager.imager.setvp.function">setvp</link>. Usually the default will be acceptable.
\end{description}

To make a reasonable approximation to the sky, one should divide
the type='singledish' image by the type='coverage' image, thresholding
at some level. For example:

\begin{verbatim}

ia.open('scanweight'); 
 ia.statistics(s);	
threshold = s.max / 10.0;
#
ia.imagecalc('sdimage',
	      pixels=spaste('scanimage[scanweight&gt;', threshold,
			    ']/scanweight[scanweight&gt;', threshold, ']'))
###ia.view(raster=True, axislabels=True);

   <shortdescription>Make an initial model image from a

<description>
This functions use an image from a single dish and make a model
(clean component) image out of it. This allows one to use this as the
starting model in a deconvoltion  function e.g
<link anchor="imager:imager.clean.function">clean</link> or <link anchor="imager:imager.mem.function">mem</link>
This provides an alternative to
<link anchor="imager:imager.feather.function">feather</link>.
The difference between the two is that in {\tt feather} the
interferometer image is deconvolved first and the single dish image is 
put in at the end. Whereas if one starts with a model from the single
dish image it will give a different starting point for the deconvolving
algorithm to interpolate the missing short baseline. 

The function <link anchor="imager:imager.setsdoptions.function">setsdoptions</link> may be used to set
a factor by which to scale the SD image, if necessary.

The {\tt sdpsf} parameter (optional) should be used if an external PSF image of the 
single dish is needed to calculate the beam parameters of the primary
beam of the dish. This is usually needed if the dish image is from a
non standard telescope or the beam is not in the {\tt CASA} system.

The {\tt mask} is a mask image that may be needed to be used for
clean.  This is usually the case when the dish image does not fully
cover the field defined by <link anchor="imager:imager.defineimage.function">defineimage</link>.

   <method type="function" name="mask">
   <shortdescription>Construct a mask image by thresholding an image</shortdescription>
   
<description>
A mask image is an image with the same shape as the other images but
with values between 0.0 and 1.0 as a pixel value. Mask images are used
in {\tt imager} to control the region selected in a deconvolution.
One makes a mask image by clipping the I part of the restored image
(this function) or via the <link anchor="imager:imager.boxmask.function">boxmask</link>,
<link anchor="imager:imager.regionmask.function">regionmask</link>, and 
<link anchor="imager:imager.exprmask.function">exprmask</link> functions.  In this
function, all points greater than the threshold are set to unity. The
mask is the same in I,Q,U, and V. Note that
<link anchor="imager:imager.exprmask.function">exprmask</link> is the most powerful
method for making mask images.

In the Clark CLEAN, the mask image can usefully have any value between
0.0 and 1.0. Intermediate value discourage but do not rule out
selection of clean components in that region. This is accomplished by
multiplying the residual image by the mask prior to entering the minor
cycle.

Note that if you do use a mask for the Clark or Hogbom Clean, it must
cover only a quarter of the image. It is particularly important to
check this when creating an image using a threshold. If it extends
further, the easiest fix is to use
<link anchor="images:image.getchunk.function">getchunk</link> and
<link anchor="images:image.getchunk.function">getchunk</link> to set parts of it to zero.

   <shortdescription>Calculate a deconvolved image with selected mem (maximum entropy) algorithm</shortdescription>
   
<description>
Makes a mem image using either the Cornwell-Evans maximum entropy or
maximum emptiness algorithms, using the single field or multi-field
contexts. The maximum entropy algorithm is the default. The mem is performed
on the residual image calculated from the visibility data currently
selected. Hence the first step performed in mem is to transform the
current model or models (optionally including a componentlist) to fill
in the MODEL\_DATA column, and then inverse transform the residual
visibilities to get a residual image. This residual image is then
deconvolved using the corresponding point spread function. This means that
the initial model is used as the starting point for the
deconvolution. Thus if you want to restart a mem, simply set the
model to the model that was previously produced by clean.

Mask images are used to constrain the region that is to be
deconvolved. To make mask images, use either
<link anchor="imager:imager.boxmask.function">boxmask</link> (to define a mask via the
corner locations blc and trc) or <link anchor="imager:imager.mask.function">mask</link> (to
define a mask via thresholding an existing image). The default mask is
the inner quarter of the image.

The MEM deconvolution only operates on one Stokes parameter at a time.
Joint MEM deconvolution for multiple Stokes parameters will be
implemented in the future.

Astronomy and Astrophysics (ISSN 0004-6361), vol. 143, no. 1, Feb. 1985,

The mem algorithms possible are:
\begin{description}
\item[Cornwell-Evans Maximum Entropy (entropy)] The classic "vm" or "vtess" 
deconvolution algorithm.
\item[Cornwell-Evans Maximum Emptiness (emptiness)] The historic, but 
largely undocumented, modification to the Cornwell-Evans algorithm
which seeks a model image which is consistent with the data and
simultaneously minimizes the number of pixels with no emission
(meaning "with pixel values below the noise level").
\item[Multi-field Maximum Entropy (mfentropy)] Deconvolution is split
into minor and major cycles. For each field, the MEM analog of a Clark
Clean minor cycle is performed. In the major cycle, the emission thus
modelled is subtracted either from the original visibilities (for
multiple fields) or using a convolution (for only one field). The
latter is much faster.
\item[Multi-field Maximum Emptiness (mfemptiness)] Just like {\tt mfentropy},
but with emptiness.
\end{description}

The multi-field mem ({\tt mfentropy} or {\tt mfemptiness}) should be
used if either of two conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Multiple fields are to be deconvolved simultaneously {\bf OR}
\item Primary beam correction is enabled. In this case, a
mosaiced mem is performed.
\end{enumerate}

Note that for the single pointing algorithms, only a quarter of the
image may be deconvolved. If no mask is set, then the deconvolved
region defaults to the inner quarter. If a mask larger than a quarter
of the image is set, then only the quarter starting at the bottom left
corner is used.  However, for the multi-field imaging, the entire
field may be imaged because the major cycles either do an exact
subtraction from the visibilities or because PSF extent is more than
twice the extent of the primary beam support.

Before {\tt mem} can be run, you must run {\tt selectvis} and {\tt defineimage}.
Before {\tt mem} can be run with a multi-field algorithm, you should run
{\tt setvp}.  You may want to run {\tt setmfcontrol} before running {\tt mem}
with a multi-field algorithm, though the default control values
may be acceptable.

   <shortdescription>Calculate a deconvolved image using the 
NNLS algorithm</shortdescription>
    

<description> 

Solve for the model brightness using the Briggs' Non-Negative Least
Squares algorithm. Since NNLS works only on the $I$ image, the $I$
pixels in the current image is set to zero where the fluxmask is $\&gt; 0.0$,
then NNLS is used to estimate the $I$-pixels for that region.
The deconvolution is performed on the residual image calculated from
the visibility data currently selected. Hence the first step performed
in clean is to transform the current model to fill in the MODEL\_DATA
column, and then inverse transform the residual visibilities to get a
residual image. This residual image is then deconvolved using the
corresponding point spread function.

Some other points to remember are that rather than explicit boxes,
mask images are used to constrain the region that is to be
deconvolved.  For NNLS, there are two masks, the fluxmask specifying
the region within which flux is allowed, and the datamask specifying
the region of the dirty image to be used as constraints. Typically the
datamask will be somewhat larger than the fluxmask. On a large
machine, a practical limit to both will be about 5000-6000
pixels. Hence NNLS is only useful for compact tools.  (For more
details, see the \htmladdnormallink{Briggs thesis}{\briggsURL}).  To
make mask images, use either <link anchor="imager:imager.boxmask.function">boxmask</link> (to
define a mask via the corner locations blc and trc) or
<link anchor="imager:imager.mask.function">mask</link> (to define a mask via
thresholding an existing image).

On the canonical \aipspp\ machine with 64MBytes of physical memory,
you should try to keep the product of the pixels in the fluxmask
and the datamask below about 5-10 million. Otherwise the 
solution phase will swap badly.

   <method type="function" name="regionmask">
   <shortdescription>Construct a mask image from a region</shortdescription>
   
<description>
A mask image is an image with the same shape as the other images but
with values between 0.0 and 1.0 as a pixel value. Mask images are used in
imager to control the region selected in a deconvolution. 

In the Clark CLEAN, the mask image can usefully have any value between
0.0 and 1.0. Intermediate value is discouraged but do not rule out
selection of clean components in that region. This is accomplished by
multiplying the residual image by the mask prior to entering the minor
cycle. Note that if you do use a mask for the Clark or Hogbom Clean,
it must cover only a quarter of the image. {\tt regionmask} does not enforce
this requirement. 

The function regionmask also allows multiple regions to be used. A record of the regions can be made as in the example below. 

Regions can be made in many different ways using the
<link anchor="images:regionmanager">regionmanager</link> functions. An example
using <link anchor="images:regionmanager.wbox.function">wbox</link> function is given
below. The default regionmanager tool 'rg' can be used for cases the user want to have flexibility in manipulating regions. The {\tt region} parameter takes a record that comes from the regionmanager output.
The parameter boxes allow the user to sent in a list of 4 elements numbers representing blc's and trc's 

If both the parameters, {\tt regions} and {\tt boxes} are used the a union is done with the two sets of region thus defined.

Now one may wish to make regions and later use it with higher
resolution images etc. Regions can be stored in tables on disk and
recovered later for re-use (especially if its a long series of regions
making using the gui as described above. 


- drm.fromglobaltotable('mytab.region', 'T', 'F', "myregionoftoday", myregion1) 


The above command using the default regionmanager tool saves the
region 'myregion1' into a table 'mytab.region'
Subsequently this table is used to recover the region and use it to
create a mask image as below. We use the function drm.namesintable()
to remind ourselves under what names the regions was saved and hence
allow us to pick the one we want.



- drm.namesintable('mytab.region')

myregionoftoday

- myoldregion = drm.fromtabletoglobal('mytab.region', T, 'myregionoftoday')

Now one may wish to make regions and later use it with higher
resolution images etc. Regions can be stored in tables on disk and
recovered later for re-use (especially if its a long series of regions
making using the gui as described above. 


- drm.fromglobaltotable('mytab.region', 'T', 'F', "myregionoftoday", myregion1) 


The above command using the default regionmanager tool saves the
region 'myregion1' into a table 'mytab.region'
Subsequently this table is used to recover the region and use it to
create a mask image as below. We use the function drm.namesintable()
to remind ourselves under what names the regions was saved and hence
allow us to pick the one we want.



- drm.namesintable('mytab.region')

myregionoftoday

- myoldregion = drm.fromtabletoglobal('mytab.region', T, 'myregionoftoday')

- imagr.regionmask(mask='newmask',region=myoldregion)

   <method type="function" name="sensitivity">
   <shortdescription>Calculate rms  sensitivity</shortdescription>
   
<description>

NB: The implementation in this function will be removed for CASA v4.5.
We now recommend that the im.apparentsens() function be used instead
of this one, especially if their weights are initialized and
calibrated.

Calculate the point source sensitivity for the selected data, both
absolutely and relatively (to that for natural weighting).

To do the calculation, we use the imaging weights (in the 
column called IMAGING\_WEIGHT) as calculated from the WEIGHT column,
and an estimate of the effective net bandwidth and integration time.
The calculation therefore includes all the effects
of <link anchor="imager:imager.weight.function">weight</link> and 
<link anchor="imager:imager.filter.function">filter</link>.

The output is an array with mixed elements.  Counting from zero, the
second element (out[1]) is the net sensitivity, third element is the
ratio of the reduction in sensitivity due to the chosen weighting
scheme.  This ratio is 1.0 for Natural weight and greater than one for
all other weighting schemes.  (NOTE: Further testing is required of
this value and hence this is kept separate for now).

The sensitivity calculations require Tsys and collecting area of
the antenna. These quantities are not known from the MS.  The
sensitivity is therefore returned in units of Jy m\^2/K.  Multiplying the
second elements with the ration of the Tsys and effective antenna
collecting area will give the sensitivity in Jy/beam units.

The fourth elements of the return value is a record with the following
keys: 'nbaselines', 'effectiveintegration', 'effectivebandwidth',
'sumwt' and 'spwid'.  These can be used to get the number of baselines
used, effective integration time (in sec), the effective bandwidth (in
Hz), the sum of weights and the absolute spectral window IDs used.

   <method type="function" name="apparentsens">
   <shortdescription>Calculate rms sensitivity directly from weights</shortdescription>
   
<description>

This function calculates the point source sensitivity for the data
selected by im.selectvis(...), and according to the imaging weighting
parameters specified in im.weight(...) and im.defineimage(...).  The
calculation is performed solely using the weight information stored in
the MS WEIGHT column (WEIGHT_SPECTRUM tbd), and as adjusted by the net
imaging weighting function (natural, uniform, robust, taper, etc.).
Therefore, it is assumed that the MS WEIGHTs have been properly
initialized and calibrated along with the visibility data.  As long as
the WEIGHTs are in the inverse square units of the visibilities (i.e.,
inverse variance weights), the calculation should yield the real
theoretical imaging sensitivity for data at any stage of the
calibration (though data at early and intermediate stages of
calibration may not be sufficiently coherent for imaging at high--or
even modest--fidelity).

Two values are reported in the logger and returned (see example
below). First, the apparent sensitivity (in the units implied by the
WEIGHTs' units), for the specified imaging weighting scheme.  Second,
a unitless factor describing the ratio of the apparent sensitivity to
that obtained with pure 'natural' weighting (the nominal peak
sensitivity).  When 'natural' weighting is selected, this ratio factor
will be 1.0; all other weighting choices will yield an apparent
sensitivity ratio greater than 1.0.

Currently, this function reports only the continuum sensitivity for
the selected data, and in particular, for the aggregate bandwidth
indicated by the spectral window selection.  The calculation further
assumes that the visibility samples are each entirely independent
(i.e., no redundant samples such as would occur for overlapping
spectral windows).

A future version of this function will support reporting a sensitivity
spectrum for the spectral line case (including support for
WEIGHT_SPECTRUM).  For now, spectral line sensitivity may be
reasonably estimated by dividing the reported sensitivity by the
square root of the fractional bandwidth of a single image channel, or
by selecting a bandwidth matching the width of a single image channel.

   <shortdescription>Select visibilities for subsequent processing</shortdescription>
   
<description>
This setup tool function selects which data are to be used 
subsequently. After invocation of selectvis, only the selected
data are operated on. Thus, for example, in imaging, only the selected
data are gridded into an image, and in plotting, only the
selected data are plotted.

Data can be selected by field and spectral window ids. Note that
all data thus selected are passed to imaging, and may or
may not be imaged, depending on how the image was constructed
using <link anchor="imager:imager.defineimage.function">defineimage</link>. For example,
in mosaicing, use fieldid in defineimage to control what pointing
is used to define the field center, and use fieldid in selectvis
to control what pointings are used in the imaging.

For spectral processing, it is possible to make cubes out
multi-spectral window selections but the selection and combination can
be a bit confusing (any hint at how to make it clearer is welcome).

If the default values are not used, then data to be used can be selected channel wise. The 

\begin{description}
\item[nchan]   is the number of data channels selected. It
defaults to -1 (interpreted as all channels).
\item[start] is the first channel from input dataset that is to be used.
It defaults to 0 (i.e. first channel).
\item[step] gives the increment between selected input channels. It defaults to 1 channel. A value of {\tt n}  means that {\tt n-1} data channels will not not be used.  
\end{description}



By choosing the parameters for selectvis and defineimage correctly,
one may obtain various mappings of visibility channels to image
channels. For example, to average 512 visibility channels into 64 
image channels (producing image channels consisting of 8
visibility channels):


im.defineimage(mode='channel', spw=0, nchan=64, start=1, step=8);
im.selectvis(spw=0, nchan=512, start=1, step=1)
im.clean(.....);


This averages the spectral channels during the gridding process. If
one wanted to only include every 8th channel in the
deconvolution, one would do:


im.selectvis(nchan=64, start=1, step=8)
im.defineimage(mode='channel', nchan=64, start=1, step=8);
im.clean(....);


For velocity and opticalvelocity modes, the mstart and mstep
are the start and step velocities as strings.


im.defineimage(mode='velocity', nchan=64, start='20 km/s', step='-100m/s');
im.selectvis(spwid=[-1]); \#\#\#selecting all data spectral windows
im.clean(...);


If the image and data selections differ, then averaging is done during
the gridding and degridding process in the image deconvolution.


im.defineimage(mode='channel', nchan=64, start=1, step=8);
im.selectvis(nchan=512, start=1, step=1)
im.clean()


Note:  The channels numbers used in {\tt defineimage}
and {\tt selectvis} refers to the same channel. So if a channel is not
selected in {\tt selectvis} but is selected in {\tt defineimage}, then
blank channels image are made. The example below will result in the 
having the first 6 (0-5) channels in the image to be blank.


im.selectvis(nchan=50, start=6, step=1) \#selected chan 6-55
im.defineimage(mode='channel', nchan=50, start=0, step=1); 

 \# will try to image channel 1-50. But as previously only channel 6-55 
 \# was selected only channel 6-50 will have data; images of channels
 \# 1-5 are blank 
im.clean(....)


For multi-spectral window cube imaging the selection of the data can
be done as follows


im.selectvis(nchan=[50,60], start=[0,0], step=[1,1],
             spw=[0,1]) 
im.defineimage(mode='channel', nchan=110, start=0, step=1, spw=[0,1]); 



The above means that you would make a data selection of 50 channels
(starting from 0 steping 1) from the first spectral window and 60
channels (starting from 1 steping 1). The defineimage defines the image
to be a cube of 110 channels. The caveat is the step size in the
frequency direction is the step size of the first spectral window. If
the step size of channels of the two spectral windows are different
then one is better off defining the image cube in velocities (e.g. as below). 

                                                                      

im.selectvis(nchan=[50,60], start=[0,0], step=[1,1],
             spw=[1,2]) 
im.defineimage(mode='velocity', nchan=200, mstart='20km/s',
             mstep='-100m/s');

   <shortdescription>Set various cycle control parameters for 
multi-field and wide-field imageing.</shortdescription>
   
<description> 
Control parameters for mosaicing or wide-field imaging which are not
required in single field deconvolution are set here to streamline the
user interface.  As multifield and widefield imaging is accomplished
by deconvolution in cycles, many of these parameters control how the
deconvolution cycles are ended.

\begin{description}
\item cyclefactor: this parameter helps in lowering or increasing the
  threshold at which the deconvolution cycle will stop  and degrid and
  subtract from the visibilities. For very bad PSFs you may want to
  reconcile with the visibilties often, thus a larger number is
  required here...(4 to 5). For very well behaved data you may want to
  deconvolve deep before reconciling: a lower number is used (1.5 to 2.0). 
\item cyclespeedup: this is used if the PSF is not well behaved and
  you want clean to raise by 2 the threshold if it has not reached the
  threshold in this number of iteration
\item cyclemaxpsffraction: similar to cyclefactor, but this is an
explicit fraction of the PSF peak. The final threshold is computed
using  min( cyclemaxpsffraction, cyclefactor * maxPSFsidelobe).
Valid values are between 0.0 and 1.0. 
\item stoplargenegatives: This parameter is exclusively for when using
  multiscale clean. This is used to stop the component
  search when the largest scale has found this number of negative
  components. -1 here means that continue component search even if the
  largest component is negative. 
\item stoppointmode: Again exclusively for when using multiscale
  clean. The clean will stop if the smallest scale receives this
  number of consecutive components. 
\item minpb: This is to defined up to what level the voltage pattern
  is going to applied when  using
  <link anchor="imager:imager.setvp.function">setvp</link>. The default is 0.1 of the
  primary beam or the voltage pattern defined for the antenna.
\item scaletype: This parameter cab be NONE or SAULT. If NONE the
  image is not scaled, if SAULT is used the image is weighted so that
  the noise is kept uniform across the image. The next two parameters
  defines how the SAULT weighting is limited. Obviously then the flux
  scale is not uniform across the image. To get the right flux
  multiply the image with the fluxscale image.
\item constpb: this parameter defines up to what amplitude of the
  Primary beam the noise floor is kept uniform, when using SAULT as scaletype.
\item fluxscale: use this to give a filename to store the factor image
  to apply to the image to get the fluxscale right.
\item flatnoise: (default true) Set to false if you want clean components for mosaic  to be searched in the residual image that is effectively multiplied by the $beam^2$. This means when the noise is determined after the antenna, searching in the optimum domain of $signal/(sigma^2)$. For meter wavelengths where noise is determined by the sky, it is no longer optimal.

   <shortdescription>Set some general options for subsequent processing</shortdescription>
   
<description>
This function is for setting different gridding and memory options

\begin{description}
\item[ftmachine] The options for ftmachine are: 
\begin{description}
\item[ft] Standard interferometric gridding
\item[sd] Standard single dish gridding
\item[both] ft and sd as appropriate.
\item[wproject] option for using the wproject algorithm for wide-field
  imaging; when this option is used the parameter {\tt wprojplanes}
  define the number of convolution functions to be used
\item[mosaic] option to use the gridder that uses the primary beam as
  the convolution function in gridding

\end{description}
\item[cache] The size of the cache used (in complex pixels) during the
gridding process. The default is to use half the physical memory of
the machine as specified by the aipsrc variable system.resources.memory.
\item[tile] The side of the tile (in complex pixels) during the
gridding process.
\item[gridfunction] The gridding function used. Currently only
Box-car ('BOX') and Prolate Spheriodal Wave Function ('SF')
are supported.  In the case of Single-Dish imaging the Primary Beam ('PB'), 
Gaussian ('GAUSS'), and Gaussian * Jinc ('GJINC') also can be used. 
\item[location] For some unusual types of image, one needs to know the
location to be used in calculating phase rotations. For example,
one can specify images to be constructed in azel, in which
case, an antenna position must be chosen. One can use functions of
<link anchor="measures">measures</link>: either
<link anchor="measures:measures.observatory.function">observatory</link> to
get the position of a named observatory ({\em e.g.}
me.observatory('ATCA')) or
<link anchor="measures:measures.position.function">position</link> to set
the position ({\em e.g.}me.position('wgs84','30deg','40deg','10m')).
Although this information is available from the MeasurementSet, what
location is ambiguous in some cases {\em e.g.} VLBI.
\item[padding] When gridding and transforming, the array may be
padded by this factor in the image plane. This reduces aliasing,
especially in wide-field cleaning.
\item[usemodelcol] if this is false it tells imager to create and use the model
  visibility on the fly and in memory as far as possible...otherwise
  if it is True then imager will use the MODEL\_DATA column to do this.
\item[wprojplanes] this parameter is is used only of {\tt ftmachine}
  is set to {\tt wproject}. This defines how many convolution functions
  is used in the Wprojection gridder (a -1 implies an automatic determination).

<example>

- im.setoptions(cache=10000000, tile=32, gridfunction='BOX',
  location=me.location('vla'))

The above example is to tell imager to use memory to fit 10000000
complex numbers and tile the image with tiles of 32 pixels on a side. 
Also it tells imager to use a box function as gridding function.  The
location parameter will make imager overide the position of the
telescope to use (the default is the one it gets from the ms). 


im.open('n1333.ms')
im.selectvis(fieldid=[2:6, 8:12], spwid=[1:2])
im.defineimage(nx=800, ny=800, cellx='0.5arcsec', celly='0.5arcsec', mode='velocity', nchan=30, mstart='-10km/s', mstep='1.8km/s', spwid=[1,2],fieldid=3)
im.setoptions(ftmachine='mosaic')
im.setvp(dovp=T)
im.setoptions(ftmachine='mosaic')
im.clean(algorithm='mfclark', model='try1', niter=200)



In the above example we are making a mosaic using the fields
2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12 and we use the mosaic ftmachine. This uses the
primary beam of the telescope as the gridding function.


im.open('coma.ms')
im.selectvis(spwid=1, fieldid=1);
mydir=me.direction('J2000', '12h30m48', '12d24m0')
im.defineimage(nx=200, cellx='30arcsec', phasecenter=mydir); 
im.make('outlier1');
im.defineimage(nx=1800, cellx='30arcsec');
im.setoptions(ftmachine='wproject',wprojplanes=512, padding=1.0)
im.make('main')
im.clean(algorithm='mfclark',model=['main', 'outlier1'], niter=10000, image=['coma.image', 'outlier1.image'])
im.done()



In the above example we are using the Wprojection algorithm for 3-D
imaging. We are using 512 gridding functions. Sometimes if there is a
memory issue (very large images and many griding functions) we suggest  
the use of facetting of the image with wprojection. So the example
above would be something like below. Note that when using facets only
the {\tt wfclark} and {\tt wfhogbom} can be used for now. Note on how
an outlier field (or flanking) field is set on an interfering  source
outside of the field of interest.


im.open('coma.ms')

im.selectvis(spwid=1, fieldid=1);
mydir = me.direction('J2000', '12h30m48', '12d24m0')
im.defineimage(nx=200, ny=200, cellx='30arcsec', celly='30arcsec', phasecenter=mydir); 
im.make('outlier1');
im.defineimage(nx=3000, ny=3000, cellx='30arcsec',celly='30arcsec',facets=3);
im.setoptions(ftmachine='wproject',wprojplanes=200, padding=1.2)
im.make('main')
im.clean(algorithm='wfclark',model=['main', 'outlier1'], niter=10000)
im.done()

<description>

The multiscale clean algorithm cleans an image on a number of
different scales, decomposing the image into Gaussians of these scale sizes.
This function allows the user to set the number
of scales used (using the nscales method), or to directly control the
sizes of the scales in pixels (using the uservector method).  When using the
nscales method, the scales are calculated using the following formula:
\begin{equation}
\theta_{minor}  10.0 ^{(i- N\_{scales}/2)/2.0}
\end{equation}
where $\theta_{min}$ is the fitted minor axis of the clean beam. The
first value is zero.

Note: 0 pixel is the delta function, so if one were to select scale 0 only
it would be  equivalent to a Hogbom clean.

\item[scale] The overall scale of the single dish data is multiplied by this
factor.
\item[weight] The weight given to the single dish data in the imaging

\item[convsupport] This parameter can be used to change the support used in gridding single dish data in imaging. If 'PB' or 'pb' is used as the 'convtype' in 
 <link anchor="imager:imager.setoptions.function">setoptions</link> this parameter is ignored as the support is defined by the primary beam. The deafult of -1 mans 1 as convsupport is used for 'box' convolution function and 3 is used for 'SF' convolution function.
\item[pointingcolumntouse] This parameter is NOT to be changed under normal circumstances. This is to be used by those who know what they are doing and want to try to use different columns in the POINTING table especially if they believe their dish direction is wrong. And if any of the {\tt \_OFFSET} columns is used do not expect to be able to use a different frame in the image setup in <link anchor="imager:imager.defineimage.function">defineimage</link>.

include both a high and a low frequency VP for the WSRT, a VP for each
observing band at the AT, several VP's for the VLA, including the appropriate
beam squint for each observing band, and Gaussian for the BIMA dishes.  Due to
temporary limitations in the internal structure of the visibility buffer, only
one telescope's voltage pattern can be applied to a particular MeasurementSet.
This will be corrected shortly.

This is a utility function when running multi imager processes in parallel on subsection of an ms/data independently
One would wish to weight the dirty image before averaging or set the imaging weight density (when using unform or
Brigg's style weighting) to account for all the data being used. This is {\bf NOT} for the general user but for people who 
are parallelizing at the scripting level.

   <method type="function" name="weight">
   <shortdescription>Apply additional weighting to the visibility weights</shortdescription>
   
<description>
Apply visibility weighting to correct for the local density of
sampling in the uv plane. The imaging weights are calculated on the fly 
when processing the data and can be viewed by
<link anchor="imager:imager.plotweights.function">plotweights</link>. 

To correct for visibility sampling effects, natural, uniform, radial, and Briggs weighting are supported.  These work as
follows. Then:
\begin{description}
\item[natural]: minimizes the noise in the dirty image. The weight of
the $i$-th sample is set to the inverse variance:
\begin{equation}
w\_i={1\over{\sigma\_i^2}}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_i$ is the noise of the $i$'th sample.
\item[radial]: approximately minimizes rms sidelobes for an east-west synthesis
array. The weight of the $i$-th sample is multiplied
by the radial distance from the center of the $u,v$ plane:
\begin{equation}
w\_i=w\_i \sqrt{u\_i^2+v\_i^2}
\end{equation}
\item[uniform]: For Briggs and uniform weighting, we first grid the inverse
variance $w\_i$ for all selected data onto a grid of size given by the
argument npixels (default to nx) and u,v cell-size given by
$2/$fieldofview where fieldofview is the specified field of view
(defaults to the image field of view).  This forms the gridded weights
$W\_k$. The weight of the $i$-th sample is then changed:
\begin{equation}
w\_i={w\_i\over{W\_k}}
\end{equation}
where $W\_k$ is the gridded weight of the relevant cell.
It may be shown that this minimizes rms sidelobes over
the field of view. By changing the field of view, one may suppress
the sidelobes over a region different (usually smaller) than the
image size.
\item[briggs: rmode='norm']: The weights are changed:
\begin{equation}
w\_i={w\_i\over{1 + W\_k f^2}}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
f^2={{(5*10^{-R})^2}\over{{\sum_k W\_k^2}\over{\sum\_i w\_i}}}
\end{equation}
and $R$ is the robust parameter. The scaling of $R$ is such that
$R=0$ gives a good tradeoff between resolution and sensitivity.
$R$ takes value between -2.0 (close to uniform weighting) to 2.0
(close to natural).
\item[briggs: rmode='abs']: The weights are changed:
\begin{equation}
w\_i={w\_i\over{W\_k*R^2+2*\sigma_R^2}}
\end{equation}
where $R$ is the robust parameter and $\sigma_R$ is the noise
parameter. 
\end{description}
For more details about Briggs (aka robust) weighting, see the \htmladdnormallink{Briggs thesis}
{\briggsURL}.

Note that this weighting is {\em not} cumulative since the imaging weights are
calculated from the specified weight (function of noise; usually $1/\sigma^2$) per visibility
(actually stored in the  WEIGHT column).
