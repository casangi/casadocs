<description>
The msplot \tool\ is a plotting tool for a 
<link anchor="ms:ms">measurement sets</link>.

The functionality of the msplot \tool\ extends that of the 
tableplot \tool\ to add knowledgable about 
<link anchor="ms:ms">measurement sets</link>.
The msplot \tool\ does for measurement sets what the tableplot 
\tool\ does for tables. Much of the functionality is similar 
to that of tableplot \tool\ and it may be useful to read the
tableplot \tool\ documentation.

There is also a similar plotting tool for calibration data,
<link anchor="calplot:calplot">calplot tool</link>. 
The calplot \tool\ documentation may be useful to read since the
calplot \tool\ is similar to msplot \tool\ 

\bigskip
\noindent{\bf Overview of msplot \tool\ functionality}

At present, the msplot \tool\ plots 
from a {\bf single} measurment sets only. 
Eventually data from more than one measurement set will be able to be 
accessed and plotted at the same time. Plots from the same
MeasurementSet can be overlayed and more then one plotting panel can
be created so different plots can be viewed simultaneously.

\begin{itemize}
\item{\bf Opening and Closing -} Before doing any plots you must call 
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.open.function">mp.open</link> with the 
measurment set to be plotted. When finished use
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.reset.function">mp.reset</link> to reset
the measurment set; clear any data seletion done with 
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.setdata.function">mp.setdata</link> 
as well as resets all of the plotting options back their default values.
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.done.function">mp.done</link> to close
the measurement set, and the MS plotter.

\item{\bf Plotting -} The msplot \tool\ provides 
several common plots that can be called easily, but the 
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.plotxy.function">mp.plotxy</link>
function is a generic function for plotting.
The available common plots are:
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.array.function">mp.array</link>,
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.azimuth.function">mp.azimuth</link>,
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.baseline.function">mp.baseline</link>,
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.elevation.function">mp.elevation</link>,
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.hourangle.function">mp.hourangle</link>,
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.parallacticangle.function">mp.parallacticangle</link>,
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.uvcoverage.function">mp.uvcoverage</link>,
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.uvdist.function">mp.uvdist</link>,
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.vischannel.function">mp.vischannel</link>, and
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.vistime.function">mp.vistime</link>.

There are a number of plotting options that can
be set to change the color, labels, symbol, number of plotting panels,
and many others. The 
<link anchor="smplot:msplot.plotoptions.function">mp.plotoptions</link>
function controls the plot options. It is important to note that once
a plot option is set, it remains set until a subsequent call to 
the {\bf plotoptions} method turns it off.

In addition iterative plots are provided. Iterative plots allow a user
to iterate over some column plotting for that particular item.  For
example, a user may wish to plot the uv distances for each antenna 
separately by using the iteration value of 'ANTENNA' with the mp.dist
function.

All of methods listed above have an interation parameter. Valid values
for this parameter are:
BASELINE, ANTENNA, FIELD, SPW, SCAN, FEED, and ARRAY_ID. 
To plot the the next plots in the iteration use the
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.iterplotnext.function">mp.iterplotnext</link>.
To stop the iterative plot use
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.iterplotstop.function">mp.iterplotstop</link>.
Note that a useful operation to perform before doing and interative plot
is to set the subplot option to plot multiple plots with the
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.plotoptions.function">mp.plotoptions</link>.
funcion. For example, subplot=131 will yeild a plot of three rows of plots.fntvwy


\item{\bf Data Sselection -} The 
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.setdata.function">mp.setdata</link>
function can be used to select which
data is to be viewed, more precisely antennas, fields,
UV ranges, and time selections can specified. 

\item{\bf (Un)Flagging - }
(Un)Flagging can be performed both in memory and on disk. Flagging has
recently undergone some refactoring and it is now possible to save
what has been flagged in stages (versions).  This gives msplot the 
ability to undo flagging if so desired. Also is a new button on the
plotting window that turns on the flagging mode, allowing users to
interactively select the areas of interest.  Soon there will be other
buttons for (un)flaggig, and for displaying information about the 
flagged regions.

To (un)flag data first make a plot, see the plotting section above.
The next step is to mark a region(s) on the plot.  This is done 
with the
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.markregion.function">mp.markregion</link>
function.  If a specific region is given to this function this region
is used, otherwise the regions can be marked on the plotter by selecting
square regions with the mouse.

Now there are regions marked on the plot, there are three different
actions that can be taken at this point.  The
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.locatedata.function">mp.locatedata</link>
function displays information about each of the points in the marked
regions. ({\bf Warning:} if a lot of points are selected a large 
amount of data will be given to the logger, this can slow down the
logger drastically!)  The other two actions that can be taken are
closely related
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.flagdata.function">mp.flagdata</link>
and
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.unflagdata.function">mp.unflagdata</link>,
to flag or unflag data respectively. Both of these functions allow
the flagging to be done in memory (default) or on disk.

One final function for flagging is
<link anchor="msplot:msplot.clearflags.function">mp.clearflags</link>.
{\bf Warning: This function clears all flags, all data will be unflagged
with this method.}

<!--  **********  PLOTOOPTION, DATA SELCTION FUNCTIONS  ********* -->

<method type="function" name="plotoptions">
   <shortdescription>
     Set the style of the plot.
   </shortdescription>
    
  <description> 
    Set the style of the plot.  This function allows the plot title, axis
    labels, font, plotting color, plot symbol and many, other aspects of
    the plot to be set by the user, giving the user much flexibility over
    the look of their plots.

    The various aspects that can be controlled by the user are as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item{\bf Labels:} The title that appears at the top of the plot is 
      controlled by the \title\ paramete'r.  The label along the x-axis
      and y-axis are set using the {\it xlabel} and {\it ylabel} parameters.
      If no values are not provided by the user then these labels are
      constructed from the data selected to be plotted. 
     
      To control the font size of the labels use the {\it font} parameter.
      The x-axis and y-axis labels are always set to be 2pts. smaller
      then the title, which is set at the given font size specified.

    \item{\bf Size Controls:}
       To control the size of the window, the {\it windowsize}, and
       {\it aspectratio} options can be set.

       To control the range of points plotted use the {\it plotrange}
       option.  This plot option accepts either time strings in the
       form YYYY/MM/DD/hh:mm:ss or real values.

    \item{\bf Data Point Sytles:}
      There are a number of plotoptions for  controlling the color and 
      style of the points plotted. 

      The {\it plotsymbol} option set both the color and/or shape of the
      points plotted.  It accepts the same syntax as that used by the
      {\bf pylab} plot function.  There are six different colors used:
      'k' black, 'r'ed, 'g'reen, 'b'lue, 'c'yan, 'y'ellow, wnd 'w'hite.
      The plotsymbols include, but are not limited to '+', 'o', '-',
      and '--'.  For a full list see the 
      <link anchor="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/matplotlib.py">
      matplotlib documentation</link>.

      The {\it markersize} and {\it linewidth} options control how big the
      plot symbols/lines are.

      The {\it multicolor} plot option is unique to CASA. It is used to
      specify whether or not different channels/correlations are plotted
      in different colors.  The colors used can not be set by anyof the
      plot options.  Basically, when plotting the colors are cycled through,
      changing whenever a different channel or correlation is encountered.

      For large measurement sets it may be useful to plot only a portion
      of the measurment set.  The {\it skipnrows} allows every nth row
      to be plotted rather then all of the plots.

    \item{\bf Multiple plots:} 
     One of the more useful abilities of the CASA plotters is the ability
     to plot several plot simultaneously, either side-by-side, and/or one on
     top of the other.

     The {\it subplot} option determines the number of panels to create,
     each panel contains a plot of some data.  
     Although the {\it subplot} option is a single integer, it is really
     treated as three separate integers: 
     \begin{itemize}
        \item {\it nrows}: number of rows of panels, 
        \item {\it ncols}: number of columns of panels, and
        \item {\it panel}: the panel number, which panel to plot on.
     \end{itemize}

     For example, {\it subplot=132} specifies that there are three panels
     side-by-side (three columns of panels), and that we are plotting on
     the second panel.  The top, left corner panel is panel number 1, and
     the panel number increases to the right first, continuing on the next
     row when the end of a row is reached. The example section shows
     some examples that create a number of different panel arrangements.

     Related to the multi-panel plots is the {\it removeoldpanels} option.
     This option when set to {\it True}, the default value, mimics the native 
     matplot behviour,
     clearing any panels that lie partially or completely under a new panel
     being plotted. If it is set to {\it False} new panels could potentially
     plot overtop of old panels depending on the subplot values.

     In addtions to having plots there is the ability to overplot.  The
     {\it overplot} option when set to true will, instead of clearing
     the panel that is currently being plotted on, plot over what is already
     there.  When {\it overplot} is set to true the next plot is plotted
     over top of what is already there, and if the {\it plotsymbol} has
     not been specified the {\it msplot} tool will automatically pick a
     different color to plot with.  An example where this may be useful
     if plotting different spectral windows separately, but on the same
     plot.

     Related to overplotting is the {\it replacetopplot} and 
     {\it showflags} option.  By default
     {\it replacetopplot} is set to {\it False}, but if it is set to {\it True} 
     then only
     the last plot on a panel is replaced.  This option comes in handy when
     a mistake has been made in the last plot.  If the {\it showflags} option
     is set to {\it True} then the flagged data is plotted.  A nice feature
     is the ability to plot the flagged and unflagged data on the same plot,
     by doing the same plot with both the {\it overplot} and {\it showflags}
     plot turned on.  Note that flagged data is always plotted in a magenta
     color.

   <description> 
     Select a subset of the measurement set. All plots will operate on this 
     subset of the measurement set based on the values given.

     All of the {\it Index} fields expect lists of integers. All of the 
     {\it Name} fields accept strings. Where both indices and expressions 
     are allowed as inputs (antenna's for example), they will be combined 
     together when selecting the data.

     The expression strings contain values separated by
     ','. The wildcard character '*' can be used with the names.
     The '\&gt;' and '\&lt;' characters can be used to indicate values that are 
     greater then, or less then (respectively) a particular value.

     Note: that integer values in the antennaNames list will be interpreted
     as indices. The '~' indicates a range for values.  

     Spectral windows {\it names} are bit of a special case as channel 
     information can be specified too. Spectral windows are in the 
     folling format:
         (spwlist):(channellist)
     where the spetral window and channel list follow the expression
     conventions listed above.
	 "RR,LL,RL"
         "[RR LL RR]"
         "(XX)"
     where different types of polarizations are separated by a space or
     a comma.

  <description>
     Do a sanity checks of all the inputs that have been given.
     This includes checking the plot option values (mp.plotoptions()), 
     data selection (mp.setdata()), and spectral selections
     (mp.setspectral()).

     Also included in the sanity checks is a check to see how many
     points will be plotted.  If there are millions of points to
     be plotted, but do not want to wait for a large plot try setting
     the skipnrows or averagenrows plot options.

  <method type="function" name="markregion">
   <shortdescription> Mark a rectangular region to flag or to investigate
       the data in the area.
   </shortdescription>
   
<description> 
Mark a rectangular region on the plot. Each call to {\tt markflag} allows
one region to be drawn. Any number of successive calls can be made. This
function marks and stores a list of marked regions. These regions can then
be (un)flagged, or information about the marked data can be retrieved.
To flag the data the {\tt (un)flagdata} function must be used and to find
out information about the data the {\tt locatedata} function must be
used.

In the case of multi-panel plots, the subplot parameter must be specified with 
each call. The subplot value corresponds to a row-major ordering of panels,
see the subplot plot option information.

Marking the region requires two consecutive mouse clicks at the two diagonally 
opposite corners. A hatched rectangle will appear over the selected region. 
Alternative a specific region can be given to this function with the 
{\tt region} parameter.

<description> 
Set flags for all regions marked using {\tt markflags()}. The plot is
automatically redrawn after applying flags.

If reduction TaQL functions such as {\tt sum,mean} are used, flags
corresponding to all accessed values will be modified. For example, with
a measurement set table, flagging on the mean amplitude of stokes 1 and
channels 1 to 5, given by 'MEAN(AMPLITUDE(DATA[1,1:5]))' results in flags
being set for all 5 accessed channels.

For a measurement set, by default, flags are set only for accessed channels
and stokes when the DATA column is used. However all channels/stokes can be
flagged for the marked flag regions by setting the corresponding row flag.
