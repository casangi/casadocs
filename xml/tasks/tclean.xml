  <shortdescription>Radio Interferometric Image Reconstruction</shortdescription>

  <description>Form images from visibilities and reconstruct a sky model.
                         This task handles continuum images and spectral line cubes,
                         supports outlier fields, contains standard clean based algorithms
                         along with algorithms for multi-scale and wideband image
                         reconstruction, widefield imaging correcting for the w-term,
                         full primary-beam imaging and joint mosaic imaging (with
                         heterogeneous array support for ALMA).

                       example : imagename='try'

                       Output images will be (a subset of) :

                       try.psf              - Point spread function
                       try.residual      - Residual image
                       try.image         - Restored image
                       try.model         - Model image (contains only flux components)
                       try.sumwt        - Single pixel image containing sum-of-weights.
                                                 (for natural weighting, sensitivity=1/sqrt(sumwt))
                       try.pb              - Primary beam model (values depend on the gridder used)

                       Widefield projection algorithms (gridder=mosaic,awproject) will
                       compute the following images too.
                       try.weight        - FT of gridded weights or the
                                                 un-normalized sum of PB-square (for all pointings)
                                                 Here, PB = sqrt(weight) normalized to a maximum of 1.0

                       For multi-term wideband imaging, all relevant images above will
                       have additional .tt0,.tt1, etc suffixes to indicate Taylor terms,
                       plus the following extra output images.
                       try.alpha            - spectral index
                       try.alpha.error   - estimate of error on spectral index
                       try.beta              - spectral curvature (if nterms \&gt; 2)

                       Tip : Include a directory name in 'imagename' for all
                               output images to be sent there instead of the
                               current working directory : imagename='mydir/try'

                       Tip : Restarting an imaging run without changing 'imagename'
                               implies continuation from the existing model image on disk.
                                - If 'startmodel' was initially specified it needs to be set to &quot;&quot;
                                  for the restart run (or tclean will exit with an error message).
                                - By default, the residual image and psf will be recomputed
                                  but if no changes were made to relevant parameters between
                                  the runs, set calcres=False, calcpsf=False to resume directly from
                                  the minor cycle without the (unnecessary) first major cycle.
                                To automatically change 'imagename' with a numerical
                                increment, set restart=False (see tclean docs for 'restart').

                        Note : All imaging runs will by default produce restored images.
                                  For a niter=0 run, this will be redundant and can optionally
                                  be turned off via the 'restoration=T/F' parameter.

                                        In such a situation, please split out only the unflagged correlation into

<description>Name of starting model image

                      The contents of the supplied starting model image will be
                      copied to the imagename.model before the run begins.

                      example : startmodel = 'singledish.im'

                      For deconvolver='mtmfs', one image per Taylor term must be provided.
                      example : startmodel = ['try.model.tt0', 'try.model.tt1']
                                      startmodel = ['try.model.tt0']  will use a starting model only

                       This starting model can be of a different image shape and size from
                       what is currently being imaged. If so, an image regrid is first triggered
                       to resample the input image onto the target coordinate system.

                       A common usage is to set this parameter equal to a single dish image

                       Negative components in the model image will be included as is.

                      [ Note : If an error occurs during image resampling/regridding,
                                   please try using task imregrid to resample the starting model

                                               base spectral frame. However imaging code internally uses the fixed

                                               Doppler tracking so that a spectral line observed over an
                                               extended time range will line up appropriately.
                                               Therefore the output images have additional spectral frame conversion

                         When calculating weight density for Briggs
                         style weighting in a cube, this parameter
                         determines whether to calculate the weight
                         density for each channel independently 
                         (the default, True)
                         or a common weight density for all of the selected
                         data. This parameter has no
                         meaning for continuum (specmode='mfs') imaging
                         or for natural and radial weighting schemes.
                         For cube imaging
                         perchanweightdensity=True is a recommended
                         option that provides more uniform
                         sensitivity per channel for cubes, but with
                         generally larger psfs than the
                         perchanweightdensity=False (prior behavior)
                         option. When using Briggs style weight with
                         perchanweightdensity=True, the imaging weight
                         density calculations use only the weights of
                         data that contribute specifically to that
                         channel. On the other hand, when
                         perchanweightdensity=False, the imaging
                         weight density calculations sum all of the
                         weights from all of the data channels
                         selected whose (u,v) falls in a given uv cell
                         on the weight density grid. Since the
                         aggregated weights, in any given uv cell,
                         will change depending on the number of
                         channels included when imaging, the psf
                         calculated for a given frequency channel will
                         also necessarily change, resulting in
                         variability in the psf for a given frequency
                         channel when perchanweightdensity=False. In
                         general, perchanweightdensity=False results
                         in smaller psfs for the same value of
                         robustness compared to
                         perchanweightdensity=True, but the rms noise
                         as a function of channel varies and increases
                         toward the edge channels;
                         perchanweightdensity=True provides more
                         uniform sensitivity per channel for
                         cubes. This may make it harder to find
                         estimates of continuum when
                         perchanweightdensity=False. If you intend to
                         image a large cube in many smaller subcubes
                         and subsequently concatenate, it is advisable
                         to use perchanweightdensity=True to avoid
                         surprisingly varying sensitivity and psfs
                         across the concatenated cube.

<description>Gridding options (standard, wproject, widefield, mosaic, awproject)

                       The following options choose different gridding convolution
                       functions for the process of convolutional resampling of the measured
                       visibilities onto a regular uv-grid prior to an inverse FFT.
                       Model prediction (degridding) also uses these same functions.
                       Several wide-field effects can be accounted for via careful choices of
                       convolution functions. Gridding (degridding) runtime will rise in
                       proportion to the support size of these convolution functions (in uv-pixels).

                       standard : Prolate Spheroid with 7x7 uv pixel support size

                                           wprojplanes is the number of distinct w-values at
                                           which to compute and use different gridding convolution
                                           functions (see help for wprojplanes).
                                          Convolution function support size can range
                                           from 5x5 to few 100 x few 100.

                                        are gridded separately using their respective phase centers
                                        (to minimize max W). Deconvolution is done on the joint
                                        full size image, using a PSF from the first subregion.

                                               the image domain before a joint minor cycle.

                                               VLA/ALMA PB models are same as for gridder='mosaicft'

                  ------ Notes on PB models :

                       (1) Several different sources of PB models are used in the modes
                            listed above. This is partly for reasons of algorithmic flexibility
                            and partly due to the current  lack of a common beam model
                            repository or consensus on what beam models are most appropriate.

                       (2) For ALMA and gridder='mosaic', ray-traced (TICRA) beams
                            are also available via the vpmanager tool.
                            For example, call the following before the tclean run.
                           vp.setpbimage(telescope=&quot;ALMA&quot;,
                           compleximage='/home/casa/data/trunk/alma/responses/ALMA_0_DV__0_0_360_0_45_90_348.5_373_373_GHz_ticra2007_VP.im',
                           antnames=['DV'+'%02d'%k for k in range(25)])
                           vp.saveastable('mypb.tab')
                           Then, supply vptable='mypb.tab' to tclean.
                           ( Currently this will work only for non-parallel runs )


                ------ Note on PB masks :

                         In tclean, A-Projection gridders (mosaic and awproject) produce a
                         .pb image and use the 'pblimit' subparameter to decide normalization
                         cutoffs and construct an internal T/F mask in the .pb and .image images.
                         However, this T/F mask cannot directly be used during deconvolution
                         (which needs a 1/0 mask). There are two options for making a pb based
                         deconvolution mask.
                            -- Run tclean with niter=0 to produce the .pb, construct a 1/0 image
                         with the desired threshold (using ia.open('newmask.im');
                         ia.calc('iif(&quot;xxx.pb&quot;&gt;0.3,1.0,0.0)');ia.close() for example),
                         and supply it via the 'mask' parameter in a subsequent run
                         (with calcres=F and calcpsf=F to restart directly from the minor cycle).
                            -- Run tclean with usemask='pb' for it to automatically construct
                         a 1/0 mask from the internal T/F mask from .pb at a fixed 0.2 threshold.

                ----- Making PBs for gridders other than mosaic,awproject

                      After the PSF generation, a PB is constructed using the same
                      models used in gridder='mosaic' but just evaluated in the image
                      domain without consideration to weights.

                       For large image cubes, the gridders can run into memory limits
                       as they loop over all available image planes for each row of data

                       An appropriate value of wprojplanes depends on the presence/absence
                       of a bright source far from the phase center, the desired dynamic

                       it if artifacts persist. W-term artifacts (for the VLA) typically look
                       like arc-shaped smears in a synthesis image or a shift in source
                       position between images made at different times. These artifacts
                       are more pronounced the further the source is from the phase center.

                       There is no harm in simply always choosing a large value (say, 1024)
                       but there will be a significant performance cost to doing so, especially
                       for gridder='awproject' where it is combined with A-Projection.

                       wprojplanes=-1 is an option for gridder='widefield' or 'wproject'
                       in which the number of planes is automatically computed.

                       sky spectrum for the minor cycle to model and reconstruct [Bhatnagar et al., ApJ, 2013].

                       As a rough guideline for when this is relevant, a source at the half power 
                       point of the PB at the center frequency will see an artificial spectral 
                       index of -1.4 due to the frequency dependence of the PB [Sault and Wieringa, 1994].  
                       If left uncorrected during gridding, this spectral structure must be modeled 
                       in the minor cycle (using the mtmfs algorithm) to avoid dynamic range limits 
                       (of a few hundred for a 2:1 bandwidth).

                        Note : The default value of this parameter is [], due a programmatic constraint.
                                   If run with this value, it will internally pick [600,600] and exercise the

                        [10.0, 100.0] : Based on entries in the POINTING subtable, antennas 
                                               are grouped into clusters based on a 10arcsec bin size. 
                                               All antennas in a bin are given a pointing offset calculated
                                               as the average of the offsets of all antennas in the bin.
                                               On the time axis, offset changes upto 100 arcsec will be ignored.

                        [10.0,10.0] : Calculate separate pointing offsets for each antenna group
                                             (with a 10 arcsec bin size). As a function of time, recalculate 
                                             the antenna binning if the POINTING table entries change by
                                             more than 10 arcsec w.r.to the previously computed binning.
                                              
                        [1.0, 1.0] :  Tight tolerances will imply a fully heterogenous situation where 
                                           each antenna gets its own pointing offset. Also, time-dependent 
                                           offset changes greater than 1 arcsec will trigger recomputes of 
                                           the phase gradients. This is the most general situation and is also 
                                           the most expensive option as it constructs and uses separate 
                                           phase gradients for all baselines and timesteps. 

                        For VLASS 1.1 data with two kinds of pointing offsets, the recommended
                        setting is [ 30.0, 30.0 ].

                        For VLASS 1.2 data with only the time-dependent pointing offsets, the
                        recommended setting is [ 300.0, 30.0 ] to turn off the antenna grouping
                        but to retain the time dependent corrections required from one timestep
                        to the next.

<description>Name of minor cycle algorithm (hogbom,clark,multiscale,mtmfs,mem,clarkstokes)

                       Each of the following algorithms operate on residual images and psfs
                       from the gridder and produce output model and restored images.
                       Minor cycles stop and a major cycle is triggered when cyclethreshold
                       or cycleniter are reached. For all methods, components are picked from
                       the entire extent of the image or (if specified) within a mask.

                       hogbom : An adapted version of Hogbom Clean [Hogbom, 1974]

                                         from regions of the residual image where the two overlap.
                                       - Repeat

                                  This set of scale sizes should represent the sizes
                                  (diameters in units of number of pixels)
                                  of dominant features in the image being reconstructed.

                                  The smallest scale size is recommended to be 0 (point source),
                                  the second the size of the synthesized beam and the third 3-5

                                  beam is 10&quot; FWHM and cell=2&quot;,try scales = [0,5,15].

                                  For numerical stability, the largest scale must be
                                  smaller than the image (or mask) size and smaller than or
                                  comparable to the scale corresponding to the lowest measured

<description>Number of Taylor coefficients in the spectral model

                       - nterms=1 : Assume flat spectrum source
                       - nterms=2 : Spectrum is a straight line with a slope
                       - nterms=N : A polynomial of order N-1

                       From a Taylor expansion of the expression of a power law, the
                       spectral index is derived as alpha = taylorcoeff_1 / taylorcoeff_0

                       Spectral curvature is similarly derived when possible.

                       The optimal number of Taylor terms depends on the available
                       signal to noise ratio, bandwidth ratio, and spectral shape of the
                       source as seen by the telescope (sky spectrum x PB spectrum).

                       nterms=2 is a good starting point for wideband EVLA imaging
                       and the lower frequency bands of ALMA (when fractional bandwidth
                       is greater than 10%) and if there is at least one bright source for
                       which a dynamic range of greater than few 100 is desired.

                       Spectral artifacts for the VLA often look like spokes radiating out from
                       a bright source (i.e. in the image made with standard mfs imaging).
                       If increasing the number of terms does not eliminate these artifacts,
                       check the data for inadequate bandpass calibration. If the source is away
                       from the pointing center, consider including wide-field corrections too.

                       (Note : In addition to output Taylor coefficient images .tt0,.tt1,etc

                                   spectral index (.alpha.error) and spectral curvature (.beta,

                                     as peakresidual/10. Additional masking based on
                                    .alpha/.alpha.error may be desirable.
                                   - .alpha.error is a purely empirical estimate derived
                                     from the propagation of error during the division of
                                     two noisy numbers (alpha = xx.tt1/xx.tt0) where the
                                     'error' on tt1 and tt0 are simply the values picked from
                                     the corresponding residual images. The absolute value
                                     of the error is not always accurate and it is best to interpret

                          The following parameters are currently allowed to be different between
                          the main field and the outlier fields (i.e. they will be recognized if found
                          in the outlier text file). If a parameter is not listed, the value is picked from
                          what is defined in the main task input.

                              gridder, deconvolver, wprojplanes

                          Note : 'specmode' is an option, so combinations of mfs and cube
                                     for different image fields, for example, are supported.
                                    'deconvolver' and 'gridder' are also options that allow different
                                     imaging or deconvolution algorithm per image field.

                                     For example, multiscale with wprojection and 16 w-term planes
                                     on the main field and mtmfs with nterms=3 and wprojection
                                     with 64 planes on a bright outlier source for which the frequency
                                     dependence of the primary beam produces a strong effect that
                                     must be modeled.   The traditional alternative to this approach is
                                     to first image the outlier, subtract it out of the data (uvsub) and
                                     then image the main field.

                          Note : If you encounter a use-case where some other parameter needs
                                    to be allowed in the outlier file (and it is logical to do so), please
                                    send us feedback. The above is an initial list.

           <shortdescription>Weighting scheme (natural,uniform,briggs, briggsabs[experimental])</shortdescription>
<description>Weighting scheme (natural,uniform,briggs,superuniform,radial, briggsabs)

                       During gridding of the dirty or residual image, each visibility value is
                       multiplied by a weight before it is accumulated on the uv-grid.
                       The PSF's uv-grid is generated by gridding only the weights (weightgrid).

                       weighting='natural' : Gridding weights are identical to the data weights
                                                         from the MS. For visibilities with similar data weights,
                                                         the weightgrid will follow the sample density
                                                         pattern on the uv-plane. This weighting scheme
                                                         provides the maximum imaging sensitivity at the
                                                         expense of a possibly fat PSF with high sidelobes.
                                                         It is most appropriate for detection experiments
                                                         where sensitivity is most important.

                       weighting='uniform' : Gridding weights per visibility data point are the
                                                          original data weights divided by the total weight of
                                                          all data points that map to the same uv grid cell :
                                                          ' data_weight / total_wt_per_cell '.

                                                          The weightgrid is as close to flat as possible resulting
                                                          in a PSF with a narrow main lobe and suppressed
                                                          sidelobes. However, since heavily sampled areas of
                                                          the uv-plane get down-weighted, the imaging
                                                          sensitivity is not as high as with natural weighting.
                                                          It is most appropriate for imaging experiments where
                                                          a well behaved PSF can help the reconstruction.

                       weighting='briggs' :  Gridding weights per visibility data point are given by
                                                         'data_weight / ( A *total_wt_per_cell + B ) ' where
                                                         A and B vary according to the 'robust' parameter.

                                                         robust = -2.0 maps to A=1,B=0 or uniform weighting.
                                                         robust = +2.0 maps to natural weighting.
                                                         (robust=0.5 is equivalent to robust=0.0 in AIPS IMAGR.)

                                                         Robust/Briggs weighting generates a PSF that can
                                                         vary smoothly between 'natural' and 'uniform' and
                                                         allow customized trade-offs between PSF shape and
                                                         imaging sensitivity.
                        weighting='briggsabs' : Experimental option.
                                                         Same as Briggs except the formula is different A=
                                                         robust*robust and B is dependent on the
                                                         noise per visibility estimated. Giving noise='0Jy'
                                                         is a not a reasonable option.
                                                         In this mode (or formula)  robust values
                                                         from -2.0 to 0.0 only make sense (2.0 and
                                                         -2.0 will get the same weighting)

                       weighting='superuniform' : This is similar to uniform weighting except that
                                                                    the total_wt_per_cell is replaced by the
                                                                    total_wt_within_NxN_cells around the uv cell of
                                                                    interest.  ( N = subparameter 'npixels' )

                                                                   This method tends to give a PSF with inner
                                                                   sidelobes that are suppressed as in uniform
                                                                   weighting but with far-out sidelobes closer to
                                                                   natural weighting. The peak sensitivity is also
                                                                   closer to natural weighting.

                       weighting='radial' : Gridding weights are given by ' data_weight * uvdistance '

                                                      This method approximately minimizes rms sidelobes
                                                      for an east-west synthesis array.

<description>Maximum number of iterations

                       A stopping criterion based on total iteration count.
                       Currently the parameter type is defined as an integer therefore the integer value 
                       larger than 2147483647 will not be set properly as it causes an overflow.

                       Iterations are typically defined as the selecting one flux component
                       and partially subtracting it out from the residual image.

                       niter=0 : Do only the initial major cycle (make dirty image, psf, pb, etc)

                       niter larger than zero : Run major and minor cycles.

                       Note : Global stopping criteria vs major-cycle triggers

                                  In addition to global stopping criteria, the following rules are
                                  used to determine when to terminate a set of minor cycle iterations
                                  and trigger major cycles [derived from Cotton-Schwab Clean, 1984]

                                  'cycleniter' : controls the maximum number of iterations per image
                                                      plane before triggering a major cycle.

                                                              max sidelobe level of the PSF and peak residual.
                                   Divergence, detected as an increase of 10% in peak residual from the
                                   minimum so far (during minor cycle iterations)

                                   The first criterion to be satisfied takes precedence.

                                   deconvolver operates in sequence, iterations are counted across
                                   all planes (or image fields). The iteration count is compared with
                                   'niter' only after all channels/planes/fields have completed their
                                   minor cycles and exited either due to 'cycleniter' or 'cyclethreshold'.
                                   Therefore, the actual number of iterations reported in the logger
                                   can sometimes be larger than the user specified value in 'niter'.
                                   For example, with niter=100, cycleniter=20,nchan=10,threshold=0,
                                   a total of 200 iterations will be done in the first set of minor cycles
                                   before the total is compared with niter=100 and it exits.

                        Note : Additional global stopping criteria include
                                  - no change in peak residual across two major cycles
                                  - a 50% or more increase in peak residual across one major cycle

<description>Stopping threshold (number in units of Jy, or string)

                      A global stopping threshold that the peak residual (within clean mask)
                      across all image planes is compared to.

                      threshold = 0.005  : 5mJy
                      threshold = '5.0mJy'

                      Note : A 'cyclethreshold' is internally computed and used as a major cycle
                                 trigger. It is related what fraction of the PSF can be reliably
                                 used during minor cycle updates of the residual image. By default
                                 the minor cycle iterations terminate once the peak residual reaches
                                 the first sidelobe level of the brightest source.

                                 'cyclethreshold' is computed as follows using the settings in
                                  parameters 'cyclefactor','minpsffraction','maxpsffraction','threshold' :

                                psf_fraction = max_psf_sidelobe_level * 'cyclefactor'
                                psf_fraction = max(psf_fraction, 'minpsffraction');
                                psf_fraction = min(psf_fraction, 'maxpsffraction');
                                cyclethreshold = peak_residual * psf_fraction
                                cyclethreshold = max( cyclethreshold, 'threshold' )

                                If nsigma is set (&gt;0.0), the N-sigma threshold is calculated (see
                                the description under nsigma), then cyclethreshold is further modified as,

                                cyclethreshold = max( cyclethreshold, nsgima_threshold )


                                'cyclethreshold' is made visible and editable only in the
                                interactive GUI when tclean is run with interactive=True.

                       Note : cycleniter applies per image plane, even if cycleniter x nplanes
                                  gives a total number of iterations greater than 'niter'. This is to

                                                       The mask has to have the same shape in velocity and Stokes planes
                                                       as the output image. Exceptions are single velocity and/or single
                                                       Stokes plane masks. They will be expanded to cover all velocity and/or
                                                       Stokes planes of the output cube.

                       Note : Mask images for deconvolution must contain 1 or 0 in each pixel.
                                  Such a mask is different from an internal T/F mask that can be
                                  held within each CASA image. These two types of masks are not
                                  automatically interchangeable, so please use the makemask task
                                  to copy between them if you need to construct a 1/0 based mask
                                  from a T/F one.

                       Note : Work is in progress to generate more flexible masking options and
                                  enable more controls.

<description> Restart using existing images (and start from an existing model image)

                                  run will start from this model (i.e. predicting it using current gridder
                                  settings and starting from the residual image).  Care must be taken
                                  when combining this option with startmodel. Currently, only one or
                                  the other can be used.

                                              only one model.  This situation can arise when doing one
                                              run with startmodel='xxx' to produce an output
                                              imagename.model that includes the content of startmodel,
                                              and wanting to restart a second run to continue deconvolution.
                                              Startmodel should be set to '' before continuing.

                                   If any change in the shape or coordinate system of the image is
                                   desired during the restart, please change the image name and
                                   use the startmodel (and mask) parameter(s) so that the old model
                                   (and mask) can be regridded to the new coordinate system before starting.

                         False : A convenience feature to increment imagename with '_1', '_2',
                                    etc as suffixes so that all runs of tclean are fresh starts (without
                                    having to change the imagename parameter or delete images).

                                    This mode will search the current directory for all existing
                                    imagename extensions, pick the maximum, and adds 1.
                                    For imagename='try' it will make try.psf, try_2.psf, try_3.psf, etc.

                                    This also works if you specify a directory name in the path :
                                    imagename='outdir/try'.  If './outdir' does not exist, it will create it.
                                    Then it will search for existing filenames inside that directory.

                                    If outlier fields are specified, the incrementing happens for each
                                    of them (since each has its own 'imagename').  The counters are
                                    synchronized across imagefields, to make it easier to match up sets
                                    of output images.  It adds 1 to the 'max id' from all outlier names
                                    on disk.  So, if you do two runs with only the main field
                                   (imagename='try'), and in the third run you add an outlier with
                                   imagename='outtry', you will get the following image names
                                   for the third run :  'try_3' and 'outtry_3' even though
                                   'outry' and 'outtry_2' have not been used.

     <shortdescription>Options to save model visibilities (none, virtual, modelcolumn)</shortdescription>
<description>Options to save model visibilities (none, virtual, modelcolumn)

                       Often, model visibilities must be created and saved in the MS
                       to be later used for self-calibration (or to just plot and view them).

                          none : Do not save any model visibilities in the MS. The MS is opened
                                     in readonly mode.

                                     Model visibilities can be predicted in a separate step by
                                     restarting tclean with niter=0,savemodel=virtual or modelcolumn
                                     and not changing any image names so that it finds the .model on
                                     disk (or by changing imagename and setting startmodel to the
                                     original imagename).

                          virtual : In the last major cycle, save the image model and state of the
                                       gridder used during imaging within the SOURCE subtable of the
                                       MS. Images required for de-gridding will also be stored internally.
                                       All future references to model visibilities will activate the
                                       (de)gridder to compute them on-the-fly.  This mode is useful
                                       when the dataset is large enough that an additional model data
                                       column on disk may be too much extra disk I/O, when the
                                       gridder is simple enough that on-the-fly recomputing of the
                                       model visibilities is quicker than disk I/O.
                                       For e.g. that gridder='awproject' does not support virtual model. 

                          modelcolumn : In the last major cycle, save predicted model visibilities
                                      in the MODEL_DATA column of the MS. This mode is useful when
                                      the de-gridding cost to produce the model visibilities is higher
                                      than the I/O required to read the model visibilities from disk.
                                      This mode is currently required for gridder='awproject'.
                                      This mode is also required for the ability to later pull out
                                      model visibilities from the MS into a python array for custom
                                      processing.

                        Note 1 : The imagename.model  image on disk will always be constructed
                                      if the minor cycle runs. This savemodel parameter applies only to
                                      model visibilities created by de-gridding the model image.

                        Note 2 :  It is possible for an MS to have both a virtual model
                                      as well as a model_data column, but under normal operation,
                                      the last used mode will get triggered.  Use the delmod task to
                                      clear out existing models from an MS if confusion arises.
                       Note 3:    when parallel=True, use savemodel='none'; Other options are not yet ready 
                                  for use in parallel. If model visibilities need to be saved (virtual or modelcolumn):
                                  please run tclean in serial mode with niter=0; after the parallel run

<description>Calculate initial residual image

                      This parameter controls what the first major cycle does.

                      calcres=False with niter greater than 0 will assume that
                      a .residual image already exists  and that the minor cycle can
                      begin without recomputing it.

                      calcres=False with niter=0 implies that only the PSF will be made
                      and no data will be gridded.

                      calcres=True requires that calcpsf=True or that the .psf and .sumwt
                      images already exist on disk (for normalization purposes).

                      Usage example : For large runs (or a pipeline scripts) it may be
                                                  useful to first run tclean with niter=0 to create
                                                  an initial .residual to look at and perhaps make
                                                  a custom mask for. Imaging can be resumed
                                                  without recomputing it.

      <description>Run major cycles in parallel (this feature is experimental)

                       Parallel tclean will run only if casa has already been started using mpirun.
                       Please refer to HPC documentation for details on how to start this on your system.

                       Example :  mpirun -n 3 -xterm 0 `which casa`

                       Continuum Imaging :
                          -  Data are partitioned (in time) into NProc pieces
                          -  Gridding/iFT is done separately per partition
                          -  Images (and weights) are gathered and then normalized
                          - One non-parallel minor cycle is run
                          - Model image is scattered to all processes
                          - Major cycle is done in parallel per partition

                      Cube Imaging :
                          - Data and Image coordinates are partitioned (in freq) into NProc pieces
                          - Each partition is processed independently (major and minor cycles)
                          - All processes are synchronized at major cycle boundaries for convergence checks
                          - At the end, cubes from all partitions are concatenated along the spectral axis

                      Note 1 :  Iteration control for cube imaging is independent per partition.
                                    - There is currently no communication between them to synchronize
                                       information such as peak residual and cyclethreshold. Therefore,
                                       different chunks may trigger major cycles at different levels.
                                    - For cube imaging in parallel, there is currently no interactive masking.
                                   (Proper synchronization of iteration control is work in progress.)
